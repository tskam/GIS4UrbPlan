A typical geoprocessing operation takes an input dataset, performs an operation on that dataset, and returns the result of the operation as an output dataset. Common geoprocessing operations include geographic feature overlay, feature selection and analysis, topology processing, raster processing, and data conversion.\n\nGIS analysis, on the other hand, is the process of examining the locations, attributes, and relationships of features in spatial data through overlay and other analytical techniques in order to address a question or gain useful geospatial knowledge. GIS analysis extracts or creates new information from spatial data.\n\nIn this hands-on exercise, you will learn how to combine geoprocessing and GIS analysis functions of QGIS to meet urban application needs.\n\n## Learning Outcome\n\nBy the end of this session, you will be able to:\n\n-   extract geospatial data by using appropriate geoprocessing functions of QGIS,\n\n-   create a GeoPackage database and save the extracted geospatial data into GeoPackage data table,\n\n-   transform the referencing system of the geospatial data into from geographic coordinate system (i.e wgs84) to projected coordinate system (i.e svy21). integration using appropriate overlay and statistical analysis functions of QGIS,\n\n-   derive new field from geospatial properties by using QGIS attribute table tools, and\n\n-   prepare statistical graphic by using **Data Plotly** plugin of QGIS.\n\n## Getting Started\n\n### The Task\n\nEvery fives years, Urban Redevelopment Authority of Singapore will publish the new Land-Use Master Plan (MP). It is the statutory land use plan which guides Singapore's development in the medium term over the next 10 to 15 years. The latest version was published in 2019 and the digital version is available at data.gov.sg.\n\nIn this hands-on exercise we are interested to understand the distribution of land areas by land-use allocation at the planning subzone level. The target planning area is Punggol area which comprises of seven subzones.\n\nTwo data sets will be used in this exericse, they are:\n\n-   [Master Plan 2019 Subzone Boundary (No Sea)](https://data.gov.sg/dataset/master-plan-2019-subzone-boundary-no-sea)\n\n-   [Master Plan 2019 Land Use layer](https://data.gov.sg/dataset/master-plan-2019-land-use-layer)\n\n### Creating the project folder\n\n-   Create a new project folder called `Hands-on_Ex04` or any name of your choice.\n\n-   Create a new sub-folder called `data.gov` or any name of your choice.\n\n### Downloading the data sets\n\n> DIY: Perform the following steps by using the steps you had learned from the previous hands-on exercise:\n>\n> (1) download both data sets,\n>\n> (2) place them in the newly created `data.gov` sub-folder, and\n>\n> (3) unzip both data sets.\n\n### Start a new QGIS project\n\n> DIY: Using the steps you had learned from the previous hands-on exercise:\n>\n> -   Launch QGIS.\n>\n> -   Start a new QGIS project.\n>\n> -   Save the project in `Hands-on_Ex04` folder. Name the project `Hands-on_Ex04` or any other name of your choice.\n\n## Working with QGIS geoprocessing\n\n### Geospatial data wrangling with QGIS\n\nNow, we are going to extract planning sub-zones belong to Punggol planning area from `URA_MP19_SUBZONE_NO_SEA_PL` layer.\n\n-   From the Layer pane, right click on `URA_MP19_SUBZONE_NO_SEA_PL`\n-   Select **Open Attribute Table** from the context menu.\n\nThe attribute table of `URA_MP19_SUBZONE_NO_SEA_PL` appears.\n\n-   From the menu bar of attribute table of `URA_MP19_SUBZONE_NO_SEA_PL`, click on **Select Features using an Expression** ![](img04/image3.jpg)icon\n\n**Select by Expression** dialog window appears.\n\n![](img04/image4.jpg)\n\n-   Click on the black triangle in front of *Fields and Values*.\n\n![](img04/image5.jpg)\n\nA list of field names appears.\n\n-   Double-click on `PLN_AREA_N` (i.e. Planning Area Name)\n\nThe **Expression** pane should look similar to the screenshot below.\n\n![](img04/image6.jpg){width=\"300\"}\n\n-   At the bottom of **Expression** pane, click on ![](img04/image7.jpg) icon.\n\nThe **Expression** pane should look similar to the screenshot below.\n\n![](img04/image8.jpg){width=\"300\"}\n\n-   From the right of **Select by Expression** dialog window, click on **All Unique** button.\n\nNotice that a complete list of unique value in the `PLN_AREA_N` appears.\n\n![](img04/image9.jpg){width=\"200\"}\n\n-   Scroll down the list until you see `Punggol`.

It seems that the process failed to complete due to invalid geometry issue.\n\n![](img04/image24.jpg)\n\nLess worry, this is very common in geoprocessing operations because of dirty or untidy data such as slivers. The issue can be addressed by using the Advanced options tool of QGIS's geoprocessing operations.\n\n-   At **Clip** dialog window, click on **Parameters** tab.\n\n    ![](img04/image25.jpg){width=\"199\"}\n\n-   Click on **Advanced options** ![](img04/image22.jpg){width=\"27\"} button behind Input layer.\n\n**Clip** dialog window change as shown below.\n\n![](images/paste-21713C8F.png)\n\n-   For *Invalid feature filtering*, select *Do not Filter (Better Performance)* from the drop-down list.\n\n![](img04/image27.jpg)\n\n> DIY: Repeat the same steps for *Overlay layer* too.\n\n-   When you are ready, click on **Run** button one more time.\n\nBe patient, there are a lot of polygon features to be extracted. If the process is completed without any error, the Log will look similar to below.\n\n![](img04/image28.jpg)\n\n-   Click on **Close** button to close the dialog window.\n\nWhen you refer to **Layers** panel, a new data layer called Clipped is added. Notice that there is a small marker ![](img04/image30.jpg){width=\"21\"} at the end of the layer name. It indicates that this layer is a virtual layer. In geoprocessing, it is always a good practice to keep the output layer a virtual layer first. After checking the correctness of the output layer, then only we will go ahead and save the layer into GeoPackage database.\n\n> DIY: Using the steps you had learned, save the `Clipped` virtual layer into GeoPackage, call the data layer `MP19 Land Use`.\n\n> DIY: Using the steps you had learned, remove `Clipped` virtual layer, `URA_MP19_SUBZONE_NO_SEA_PL`, and `G_MP19_LAND_USE_PL` layers from the **Layers** panel.\n\nYou screen should look similar to the screenshot below.\n\n![](img04/image31.jpg)\n\n> DIY: Using the steps you had learned in previous hands-on, symbolise the land-use by land-use classes.\n\n![](img04/image32.jpg)\n\n## Data visualisation with Data Plotly plugin\n\n### Installing Data Plotly plugin\n\nIn this section, you will learn how to visualise the distribution of land-use class by area graphically by using [**Data Plotly**](https://github.com/ghtmtt/DataPlotly) plugin.\n\n-   At the menu bar, click on **Plugins** -\\> **Manage and Install plugins**.\n\n**Plugins** dialog window appears.\n\n-   Search for **Data Plotly**.\n\n![](img04/image33.jpg)\n\n-   Click on **Install Plugin** button to install it.\n\nNotice that a new icon will be added on the menu bar.

Name the data layer as `Pre-schools`. Be warn: Check the Coordinates Referencing System of the input GIS data, if necessary an appropriate Projected Coordinates System.\n>\n> -   remove `PRESCHOOL_LOCATIONS` from **Layers Panel**\n\nNext, let us view the GIS layers in full extend.\n\n-   From the icon bar, click on Zoom Full ![](img04/image96.jpg){width=\"23\"} icon.\n\nYour screen should look similar to the screenshot below.\n\n![](img04/image97.jpg)\n\n### Preparing residential building layer\n\nNext, we will extract the residential building layer from the building data set provided by osm.\n\n> Using the steps you had learned,\n>\n> -   down, unzip and save the osm shapefiles into a folder called `shapefile` in the project folder.\n>\n> -   import `gis_osm_buildings_a_free_1` shapefile into QGIS.\n\nYour screen should look similar to the screenshot below.\n\n![](img04/image98.jpg)\n\nThe downloaded `gis_osm_buildings_a_free_1` layer covers Singapore, East Malaysia, West Malaysia (both Sabah and Sarawak states) and Brunei Darussalam. However, we are only interested on residential buildings located within Punggol Planning Area.\n\n> DIY:\n>\n> -   Using Spatial Query function of QGIS, select buildings fall within Punggol Planning Area,\n>\n> -   Export the selected buildings features into Punggol Geopackage and call it `Buildings`. Be warn: Check the Coordinates Referencing System of the input GIS data, if necessary an appropriate Projected Coordinates System.\n>\n> -   Remember to remove `gis_osm_buildings_a_free_1` layer from QGIS Layers panel.\n\nNext, let us view the GIS layers in full extend.\n\n-   From the icon bar, click on Zoom Full ![](img04/image96.jpg){width=\"23\"} icon.\n\nYour screen should look similar to the screenshot below.\n\n![](img04/image99.jpg)\n\nNow, we are going to use the selection by attribute operator of QGIS to select buildings belong to `residential` type.\n\n-   From **Layers** panel, right-click on `Buildings` layer.\n-   Select **Open Attribute Table** from the context menu.\n\nThe attribute table of `Buildings` layer appears.\n\n![](img04/image100.jpg)\n\n-   From the menu bar of the attribute table, click on **Select features using an expression** icon ![](img04/image101.jpg){width=\"23\" height=\"25\"}.\n\nThe Select by Expression dialog window appears.\n\n![](img04/image102.jpg)\n\n-   Click on the black triangle in front of **Fields and Values**.\n\n-   Double click on `type`.\n\n-   Click on **=** button.\n\n-   Click on **All Unique** button.\n\n-   Scroll the slider until `residential` appears.\n\n-   Double-click on `residential`.\n\nThe expression should look similar to the screenshot below.\n\n![](img04/image103.jpg)\n\nWhen you are ready,\n\n-   Click on **Select features** button to run the operation.\n\nIf the process completed successfully, QGIS will indicate the number of features selected at the top of the attribute table and the selected features' records will be highlighted as shown in the screenshot below.\n\n![](img04/image104.jpg)\n\n-   Close the Selection by Expression dialog windows.\n\n-   Close the attribute table.\n\nBefore we continue, it is important to save the selected residential features into a new data layer in Punggol Geopackage.\n\n> DIY: Using the steps you had learned, export the selected residential features into Punggol Geopackage and call it `Residential`. Be warn: Check the Coordinates Referencing System of the input GIS data, if necessary an appropriate Projected Coordinates System.\n\n-   Switch off `Buildings` layer because they are no longer needed.\n\nYour screen should look similar to the screenshot below.\n\n![](img04/image105.jpg)\n\n### Deriving centroids of residentail polygon features\n\nIn order to calculate the distance between the residential polygon features to the pre-school point features, we need to derive the centroid of the residential polygon features first.\n\n-   From the menu bar, select Vector -\\> Geomtry Tools -\\> Centroids.\n\n![](img04/image106.jpg)\n\nThe **Centroids** dialog window appears.\n\n-   For *Input layer*, select Residential from the drop-down list.\n\n![](img04/image107.jpg)\n\n-   When you are ready to run the operation, click on **Run** button.\n\nBefore you can blink your eyes the operation has done and a new layer called has been added onto Layers panel and display on View window as shown below.\n\n![](img04/image108.jpg)\n\n-   Close Centroids dialog window.\n\nFrom the screenshot above, it seems that the residential building centroids were sucessfully derived. However, if we zoom in closer you will notice that there are three centroids were located outside of the footprint of the residential buildings. Obviously, the built in Centroids function of QGIS failed to derive the centroid properly when the shape of the polygon is an odd shape.\n\n![](img04/image109.jpg)\n\nThe good news is that there is a QGIS plugin called **realcentroid** which is able to address the limitation of **Centroid** function.\n\n-   From menu bar, select **Plugins** -\\> **Manage and Install Plugins**.\n\n![](img04/image110.jpg){width=\"306\"}\n\n-   Search for **realcentroid** then click on **Install Plugin** button.\n\n![](img04/image111.jpg)\n\n-   After the installation completed, click on Close button to close the dialog window.\n\nNow we are ready to use realcentroid tool to derive the centroids of building polygon features.\n\n-   From menu bar, select **Vector** -\\> **realcentroid** -\\> **RealCentroid**.\n\n![](img04/image112.jpg){width=\"390\"}\n\nThe realcentroid dialog window appears.\n\n-   For *Polygon layer*, select Residential from the drop-down list.\n\n![](img04/image113.jpg){width=\"270\"}\n\n-   Fro *Output point on surface* layer, click on **Browse** button.\n\nThe Output shape file dialog window appears.\n\n-   Navigate to shapefile folder. If you have yet to create one, then go ahead to create the shapefile folder.\n\n-   Call the output shapefile `residential_centroid`.\n\n![](img04/image114.jpg)\n\n-   Click on **Save** button.\n\nThe dialog window close.\n\n-   From the realcentroid dialog window, click on check box in front of **Add to map canvas**. This will add the newly derive layer onto Layers panel and View display when the shapefile is ready.\n\n-   Click on **OK** button.\n\nAfter a few second, residential_centroid will be added on Layer panel and display on View window.\n\nNotice that all the centroids are located within the residential footprint as shown below.\n\n![](img04/image115.jpg)\n\n> DIY: Using the steps you had learned from previous section, save residentail_centroid shapefile into GeoPackage. Then remove centroid and residential_centroid shapefile from QGIS Layers panel.\n\n### Computing distance matrix\n\nNow we are ready to compute the distances between residential centroids and pre-school point features.\n\n-   From the menu bar, select **Vector** -\\> **Analysis Tools** -\\> **Distance Matrix**.\n\n![](img04/image116.jpg)\n\nThe Distance Matrix dialog window appears.\n\n-   For *Input point layer*, select `Punggol - residential centroid` from the drop-down list.\n\n-   For *Target point layer*, select `Pre-school` from the drop-down list.\n\n![](img04/image117.jpg)\n\n-   For *Output matrix type*, select **Summary distance matrix (mean, std. dev., min, max)** from the drop-down list.\n\n![](img04/image118.jpg)\n\n> Note: You are encouraged to explore all the three options so that you can understand when to change to alternative output.\n\n-   When you are ready to run the operation, click on **Run** button.\n\nAfter a few second, the process log appears on Distance Matrix indicates that the operation has completed successfully.\n\n![](img04/image119.jpg)\n\nAt the same time a temporarily layer called Distance matrix will be added on **Layers** panel and displayed on **View** window.\n\n![](img04/image120.jpg)\n\n-   At the **Distance Matrix** dialog window, click on **Close** button to close the dialog window.\n\nLet us examine the output Distance matrix layer.\n\n-   From **Layers** panel, right-click on `Distance matix` and select **Open Attribute Table** from the context menu.\n\nThe attribute table of Distance matrix appears.\n\n![](img04/image121.jpg)\n\nThe attribute table consists of five columns, namely:\n\n-   InputID: the fid of the input layer (i.e. residential centroid)\n\n-   MEAN: mean distance from a residential centroid to the 71 pre-schools.\n\n-   STDEV: standard deviation of distances from a residential centroid to the 71 pre-schools.\n\n-   MIN: minimum of distances from a residential centroid to the 71 pre-schools.\n\n-   MAX: maximum of distances from a residential centroid to the 71 pre-schools.\n\n> DIY: Using the steps you had learned, save the temporarily `Distance matrix` into GeoPackage and call it `Dismat Residential`. Then, remove `Distance matrix` from Layers panel.\n\n### Symbolosing distance values\n\nLastly, we are going to symbolise `Dismat Residential` layer by using appropriate statistical mapping techniques.\n\n> DIY: Using the quantitative mapping you had learned in previous hands-on exercise, symbolising `Dismat Residential` layer by using values from *MIN* field.\n\nYour map should look similar to the screenshot below.\n\n![](img04/image122.jpg)\n\nInteresting to note that despite there are four pre-schools located at the Northshore sub-zone however, there are several residential blocks have relatively poor accessibility to pre-schools.
