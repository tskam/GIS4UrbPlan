In this exercise, you will learn how to prepare qualitative and quantitative geovisualisation by using QGIS. You will also learn how to create a joint table by using the concept of georelational data model of GIS.\n\n## Learning Outcome\n\nBy the end of this session, you will be able to use QGIS\n\n-   to prepare qualitative maps,\n-   to create proportional symbol map,\n-   to perform georelational join,\n-   to compute new field from existing fields, and\n-   to prepare choropleth map.\n\n## Data\n\nFor the purpose of this hands-on exercise, three data sets are provided. They are:\n\n-   `education` provides general information of public primary schools, secondary schools and junior colleges. This data set was downloaded from Data.gov.sg and geocoded by using SLA OneMap Api.\n-   `sgpools` provides information of SG Pools outlets and stores information.\n-   `POP2020` provides population by age group as at June 2020. It is downloaded from Department of Statistics (DOS), Singapore. The data set provides multiple years of population data. For the purpose of this exercise, only 2020 data were extracted.\n\nThese three data sets are in csv file format. They can be found in `DataTables` of `Hand-on_Ex03` folder.\n\nBesides the above three data sets, you are required to download the following geospatial from public web sites:\n\n-   *National Map Polygon* from Data.gov.sg\n-   *Master Plan 2014 Subzone Boundary (No Sea)* from Data.gov.sg\n-   *Road Section Line* from [LTA Data Mall](https://datamall.lta.gov.sg/content/datamall/en.html).\n\n### Data Preparation\n\n> DIY: Using the steps you had learned from the previous hands-on exercise, convert the *education* and *SGPools* data sets in `DataTables` folder into geospatial data layer and store them into an integrated database called `SG`. The geospatial database must be in **GeoPackage** format.\n\n> DIY: Using the steps you had learned from the previous hands-on exercise, convert the geospatial data sets downloaded from Data.gov.sg and LTA Data Mall into the newly created `SG` database.\n\n## Getting Started\n\n> DIY: Launch QGIS. Create a new project call `Hands-on_Ex03`. Provide the project with a correct referencing system.\n\n> DIY: Using the steps you had learned from the previous hands-on exercies, import all the geospatial data in `SG` database into the newly created QGIS project.\n\n> DIY: Using the steps you had learned from the previous hands-on exercise, add OSM map layer into `Hands-on_Ex03` project.\n\nYour screen should look similar to the figure below.\n\n![](img03/image1.jpg)\n\n## Symbolising Qualitative GIS Data Layers\n\nIn this section, you will learn how to symbolise GIS data layers by using their corresponding qualitative data values.\n\n### Symbolising education GIS layer\n\nThe `type_code` field of `Education` layer provides us the school type information. In this section, you will learn how to use this field to symbolise `education` layer.\n\n-   At **Layers** panel, click on `Education` layer to make it active.\n-   Right-click on `Education` and select **Properties** from the context menu.\n\nThe **Layer Properties** dialog window appears.\n\n-   Click on the **Symbology** tab.\n\nYour screen should look similar to the screenshot below.\n\n![](img03/image2.jpg)\n\n-   Select **Categorized** from the **Symbol drop-down** list.\n\n![](img03/image3.jpg){width=\"250\"}\n\n-   For **Value**, select *mainlevel_code* from the drop-down list.\n\n![](img03/image4.jpg){width=\"350\"}\n\n-   Click on the **Classify** button.\n\nYour screen should look similar to the screenshot below.\n\n![](img03/image5.jpg){width=\"600\"}\n\nFigure above shows that `Education` layer has been categorised into five categories. They are, Junior College, Centralised Institute, Mixed Levels, Primary and Secondary.\n\nNext, you will learn how to symbolise them by using the svg vector symbol set.\n\n-   Double-click on the marker in front of *JUNIOR COLLEGE*.\n\nThe **Symbol selector** dialog window appears.\n\n![](img03/image6.jpg){width=\"550\"}\n\n-   From **Marker**, click on **Simple marker**.\n\n-   For **Symbol layer type**, select **SVG maker** from the drop-down list.\n\nScroll down the dialog window until you can see the SVG Browser as shown below.\n\n![](img03/image7.jpg){width=\"540\"}\n\n-   From the **SVG Image**, scroll-down and click on ![](img03/image8.jpg){width=\"35\" height=\"31\"}.\n\n> DIY: Change the size value and fill colour and observe the differences.\n\n-   When you are done, click on the **OK** button.\n\nYou will return to **Layer Properties** dialog window.\n\n> DIY: Using the step you had learned, change the symbols of the remaining four categories in *mainlevel_code* field.\n\nWhen you are done.\n\n-   At the **Layer Properties** dialog window, click on **Apply** button to update the changes.\n-   To close the **Layer Properties** dialog window, click on OK button.\n\nYour screen should look similar to the figure below.\n\n![](img03/image9.jpg)\n\nThis map is popularly known as **point symbol** map among the GIS and cartography communities. Prior to GIS era, this kind of map took more than a month to prepare. With GIS, it only needs less than 15 minutes to prepare. The advantage of GIS-based point symbol map is that the map can be changed easily with very little effort. GIS-based point symbol map is also highly interactive. You can navigate around the digital map and zoom in to view the distribution in greater details.\n\n> DIY: Use the steps you had learned from the previous section, symbolise the\n\n> Challenge: Using the steps you had learned in the previous section, symbolise RoadSectionLine layer according to Expressway and Roads.\n\n> Challenge: Using the steps you had learned in the previous section, symbolise National Map Polygon layer to show the outlines only.\n\nYour screen should look similar to the figure below.\n\n![](img03/image10.jpg)\n\n## Creating Proportional Symbol Map\n\n**Proportional symbol** maps (also known as **graduate symbol** maps) are a class of maps that use the visual variable of size to represent differences in the magnitude of a discrete, abruptly changing phenomenon, e.g. counts of people. Like choropleth maps, you can create classed or unclassed versions of these maps. The classed ones are known as **range-graded** or **graduated symbols**, and the unclassed are called **proportional symbols**, where the area of the symbols are proportional to the values of the attribute being mapped.\n\nIn this section, you will learn how to create a proportional symbol map showing the numbers of win by Singapore Pools' outlets.\n\n> DIY: Before we get started, let us switch off `Education`, `RoadSectionLine` and `SGOutline` layers.\n\nYour screen should look similar to the figure below.\n\n![](img03/image11.jpg)\n\nBefore you start to prepare the proportional symbol map, you will take a look at the attribute table of `SGPools` layer.\n\n-   At the **Layers** panel, right-click on `SGPools` layer.\n-   Select **Open Attribute Table** from the context menu.\n\nYour screen should look similar to the figure below.\n\n![](img03/image12.jpg)\n\nYou are going to use the values in the last filed (e.g *Gp1Gp2Winn*) to create a proportional symbol map.\n\n-   Close the table by clicking on the cross icon located at the upper right corner of the table.\n\nNext, you are going to change the size of the point symbol by mapping the values in *Gp1Gp2Winn* field.\n\n-   At the **Layers** panel, right-click on **SGPools** layer.\n-   Select **Properties** from the context menu.\n\nThe **Layer Properties** dialog window appears.\n\n-   Click on the **Symbology** icon.\n\n-   For **Value**, select *Gp1Gp2Winngs* from the dropdown list.\n\n-   For **Method**, select **Size** from the drop-down list.\n\n-   For **Size** to, type *10*.\n\n-   Click on **Classify** button.\n\nYour screen should look similar to the figure below.\n\n![](img03/image13.jpg)\n\nWhen you are ready,\n\n-   Click on **Apply** button to update the changes.\n\nIn order to view the changes, you need to close the dialog window.\n\n-   Click on **OK** to close the **Layer Properties** dialog window.\n\nYour screen should look similar to the figure below.\n\n![](img03/image14.jpg)\n\nNotice that there are many proportional symbols were overlapping. Now, you will learn how to use the layer transparent feature of QGIS to improve the visualisation.\n\n> DIY: Using the step you had learned in the earlier section, open the **Layer Properties** of `SGPools`.\n\n-   At the **Layer Properties** panel, look for **Layer rendering** sub-panel located at the bottom ot the dialog window.\n-   Click on the little triangle in front of **Layer rendering** sub-panel.\n\nThe Layer rendering subpanel extended as shown in the figure below.\n\n![](img03/image15.jpg){width=\"600\"}\n\n-   For **Opacity**, type *80%*, alternatively, you can use slider to slide toward the left until it reaches 80%.\n\nTo update the changes,\n\n-   Click on **Apply** button.\n\nLastly,\n\n-   Click on **OK** button to close the dialog window.\n\nYour screen should look similar to the figure below.\n\n![](img03/image16.jpg)\n\n• Feel free to explore other configurations. When you are done, click on the **OK** button.\n\n## Choropleth map using GIS\n\n**Choropleth mapping** involves the symbolisation of enumeration units, such as countries, provinces, states, counties or census units, using area patterns or graduated colors. For example, a social scientist may need to use a choropleth map to portray the spatial distribution of aged population of Singapore by Master Plan 2014 Subzone Boundary.\n\nThe major concerns of choropleth mapping are the method of data classification, areal symbolization, and the overall map design. General rules for choropleth mapping are as follows:\n\n-   Use data that are assumed to be uniform throughout an enumeration unit.\n-   Because enumeration units vary in size, do not map totals. Use derived values, such as ratios, rates, proportions, or percentages.\n-   The best classing method depends on the data, the map reader and the purpose of the map.\n-   When classifying data, the full range of data must be included and class values should not overlap. No more than six classes are recommended.\n-   Class symbols (i.e. colors or patterns) must be easily distinguishable.\n\nIn this section of the hands-on exercise, you will learn how to use QGIS to prepare a choropleth map showing the distribution of population with age 65 and above in Singapore by URA's Master Plan 2014 subzone. You will also gain hands-on experience on the various data classification methods, symbolisation and map layout design techniques offered by QGIS.\n\n### Adding geoadministrative layer\n\n> DIY: Using the steps you had learned from the previous section, add `Master Plan 2014 Subzone Area Boundary (No Sea)` layer into QGIS.\n\nYour screen should look similar to the figure below.\n\n![](img03/image17.jpg)\n\n### Adding an attribute table in QGIS project\n\nNow, you will add the POP2020.csv table into the QGIS project. It is stored in `\\Hands-on_EX03\\DataTables` folder and is in csv format.\n\n-   From the **Layers** toolbar, click **Add Layer** -\\> **Add Delimited Text Layer ...**.\n\nThe **Data Source Manager\\|Delimited Text** dialog window appears.\n\n![](img03/image18.jpg)\n\n-   At **File Name**, click on **Browse** button at the back.\n\nThe **Choose a Delimited Text File to Open** dialog window appears.\n\n• Navigate to \\Hands-on_Ex03\\DataTables sub folder.\n\n![](img03/image19.jpg)\n\n-   Click on `POP2020`.\\\n-   Click on the Open button.\n\nYou will return to **Data Source Manager\\|Delimited Text** dialog window.\n\n![](img03/image20.jpg)\n\nNotice that the dialog window is completed with many information and a preview table.\n\n-   For **Geometry definition**, click on the radio button in front of **No geometry (attribute only table)**.\n-   Click on **Add** button.\n\nNotice that a new data layer called `POP2020` has been added in the **Layers** panel.\n\nWe will close **Data Source Manager\\|Delimited Text** dialog window.\n\n-   Click on **OK** button.\n\nNext, you will examine the structure of the data.\n\n• Right-click on `POP2020`, select **Open Attribute Table**.\n\nThe Attribute table dialog window appears.\n\n![](img03/image21.jpg)\n\n### Creating relational join\n\nNow you are ready to perform relational join between the MP14_SubZone GIS layer and the POP2020 attribute layer.\n\nIn order to join the attribute table of a geospatial data and an aspatial attribute table, we need to identify the common key or popularly known as **unique identifier** between these two data sets.\n\n> DIY: Using the steps you had learned, open the attribute table of MP14_SubZone and POP2020.\n\n![](img03/image22.jpg)\n\nWith reference to the tables above, the *SZ* field of `POP2020` and *SUBZONE_N* field of `MP14_SUBZONE` can be used as the unique identifier filed. However, if you examine the data carefully, there is a problem we should take note of. That is strings in *SUBZONE_N* are all uppercase. On the other hand, strings in *SZ* field are made up of upper- and lowercases.\n\nIn view of this problem, we will create a new field to change strings in *SZ* into uppercase. We will call the output field *SUBZONE*.\n\n-   At the **POP2020 Feature Table**, click on **Open field calculator** icon ![](img03/image23.jpg){width=\"5%\"}\n\nThe **Field Calculator** dialog window appears.\n\n-   For **Output field name**, type *SUBZONE*.\n-   For **Output file type**, select *Text(string)* from the drop-down list.\n-   At the Expression panel, type as shown below.\n\n![](img03/image24.jpg){width=\"400\"}\n\n> Best practice: This is always a good practice to check the preview to ensure that the result is inline to what you want.\n\n-   Click on **OK** button when you are ready.\n\nNotice that a new field called SUBZONE has been added into POP2020 data table the strings are all in uppercase.\n\n![](img03/image25.jpg){width=\"500\"}\n\nYou are ready to join both tables now.\n\n-   From the **Layers** panel, double-click on **MP14_SubZone** vector layer.\n\nThe **Layer Properties** dialog window appears.\n\n• From the **Tab** menu, click on the **Joins** tab.\n\nYour screen should look similar to the figure below.\n\n![](img03/image26.jpg){width=\"1200\"}\n\n-   Click on Add new join icon ![](img03/image27.jpg){width=\"5%\"}\n\nThe **Add Vector Join** dialog window appears.\n\n-   For **Join Layer**, select `POP2020` from the drop-down list.\n-   For **Join field**, select *SUBZONE* from the drop-down list.\n-   For **Target field**, select **SUBZONE_N** from the drop-down list.\n\n![](img03/image28.jpg){width=\"350\"}\n\n-   Click on **OK** button to perform the relational join.\n\nYou will return to the **Layer Properties** dialog window.\n\nNotice that a relational joined between `POP2020` attribute table and the attribute table of `MP14_SubZone` has been created.\n\n-   At the **Layer Properties** dialog window, click on the **OK** button.\n\nStrange, it seems that nothing had happen!\n\n• At the **Layers** panel, right click on `MP14_SubZone` layer and select **Open Attribute Table** from the context menu.\n\nYou will notice that the table now contains additional fields from POP2020 attribute layer.\n\n![](img03/image29.jpg)\n\nRemember that this joint is temporary. It is not part of the attribute table of `MP14_SubZone` layer, but is just linked dynamically to the `POP2020` attribute layer. If you want to permanently join the attributes, you must save it as a new layer.\n\n### Creating a choropleth map\n\nIn this section, you will learn how to create a choropleth map showing the distribution of population age 65 and above by URA's Master Plan 2014 subzone area.\n\nFirst, you will create a new field called Age65+ and compute its value by using the calculator function of QGIS.\n\n-   From **Layers** Panel, right-click on `MP14_SubZone`, select **Open Attribute Table** from the context menu.\n\nThe `MP14_SubZone` attribute table appears.\n\n-   Click on **Open Field Calculator** icon ![](img03/image23.jpg){width=\"30\"}.\n\nThe Field calculator dialog window appears.\n\n-   Keep **Create a new field** box check.\n-   For **Output filed name**, type *Age65+*.\n-   For **Output field type**, select *Whole number (integer)* from the drop-down list.\n-   At the **Expression** panel, build a formula as shown below.\n\n![](img03/image30.jpg){width=\"350\"}\n\n> Gentle reminder: Check the preview to ensure that the result is what you want.\n\nTo perform the computation,\n\n-   Click on the **OK** button.\n\nNotice that a new field called Age65+ has been added into the attribute table of `MP14_SubZone` table.\n\n![](img03/image31.jpg)\n\nBefore you end this session, you need to save the results into the attribute table permanently.\n\n-   From the icon bar, click on the Toggle editing mode icon ![](img03/image32.jpg){width=\"25\"}.\n\nThe Stop Editing dialog appears.\n\n![](img03/image33.jpg){width=\"250\"}\n\n-   Click on **Save** button.\n-   Close the attribute table of `MP14_SubZone` layer.\n\nYou are ready to prepare the choropleth now.\n\n-   From the **Layers** panel, double-click on **MP14_SubZone** layer.\n\nThe **Layer Properties** dialog window appears.\n\n-   Click on **Symbology** tab.\n-   At **Symbol** selection drop-down list, select **Graduated** from the drop-down list.\n-   For **Value**, select *Age65+* from the drop-down list.\n-   For **Classes**, keep it as *5*.\n-   For **Color ramp**, choose *Blues* or any colour of your choice from the drop-down list.\n-   For **Mode**, choose **Natural Breaks (Jenks)** from the drop-down list. • Click on **Classify** button.\n\nYour screen should look similar to the figure below.\n\n![](img03/image34.jpg){width=\"1250\"}\n\nYou can review the statistical distribution of the classification in histogram.\n\n-   Click on the **Histogram** tab.\n-   Click on **Load values** button.\n\nYour screen should look similar to the figure below.\n\n![](img03/image35.jpg){width=\"640\"}\n\nThis feature is very useful for casual data analyst because the histogram helps us to understand the differences of each classification method.\n\n-   Click back **Classes** tab.\n-   Click on **Apply** button.\n-   Click on the OK button.\n\nYour screen should look similar to the figure below.\n\n![](img03/image36.jpg)\n\n> Challenge: Study the distribution revealed by the choropleth map. Can you identify planning subzones with high concentration of population with age 65 and above? Do these subzone tend to clusters together or randomly distributed?\n\n> DIY: Using the steps you had learned from the previous sections, create a choropleth maps of percentage of population age 65 and above.\n\n> Challenge: Compare the two choropleth maps prepared, what conclusion can you draw from the maps?\n\n## Data Preparation using SQL\n\nIn this section, you will learn how to write SQL to prepare data to meet our mapping needs. For the purpose of this exercise, [Singapore Residents by Planning Area / Subzone, Single Year of Age and Sex, June 2000-2010](https://www.singstat.gov.sg/-/media/files/find_data/population/statistical_tables/respopagesex2000to2010.ashx) will be use. It can be downloaded from this [link](https://www.singstat.gov.sg/find-data/search-by-theme/population/geographic-distribution/latest-data) of Department of Statistics, Singapore.\n\n### Importing the data into QGIS\n\n-   From the menu bar, select **Layer** -\\> **All Layer** -\\> **Add Delimited Text Layer**.\n\n![](img03/image37.jpg)\n\n**Data Source Manager** dialog window appears.\n\n-   For **File name**, navigate to the location where the data is reside.\n\n-   For **File Format**, click on the radio button in front of **CSV (comma separated values)**.\n\n-   For **Geometry Definition**, click on the radio button in front of **No geometry (attribute only table)**.\n\nYour screen should look similar to the screenshot below.\n\n![](img03/image38.jpg)\n\n-   When you are ready, click on **Add** button.\n\nNotice that a new data layer called *respopagesex2000to2010* has been added into **Layers** panel.\n\n![](img03/image39.jpg){width=\"262\"}\n\n-   Before moving on to next step, at **Data Source Manager** dialog window click on **Close** button to close the dialog window.\n\n### Examining the content of the data\n\nNext, we are going to examine the content of the data table.\n\n-   At Layers panel, right-click on *respopagesex2000to2010* and select Open Attribute Table from the context menu.\n\nThe attribute table of *respopagesex2000to2010* appears.\n\n![](img03/image40.jpg){width=\"480\"}\n\nNotice that there are a total of six columns (or known as fields) and 622986 rows (or known as records).\n\n### Deriving total population by planning area and sub-zone\n\nNext, we are going to derive a data table that aggregating the population figure for 2000 by planning area (i.e. PA) and planning subzone (i.e SZ) by SQL in DB Manager tool of QGIS. Before getting started, you are encouraged to read this [link](https://docs.qgis.org/3.22/en/docs/user_manual/plugins/core_plugins/plugins_db_manager.html).\n\n-   From the menu bar, select **Database** -\\> **DB Manager**.\n\n    ![](img03/image41.jpg){width=\"180\"}\n\nDB manager dialog window appears.\n\n-   From **Providers** panel, click on **Virtual Layers** -\\> **Project layers** -\\> *respopagesex2000to2010.*\n\nYour screen should look similar to the screenshot below. If necessary click on the **Info** tab.\n\n![](img03/image42.jpg){width=\"650\"}\n\nNotice that the beauty of **DB Manager** is that beside GeoPackage, Oracle Spatial PostGIS and SpatialLite, it is also able to work with *Virtual Layers* in the **Layer** panel.\n\nNext we are going to write the first SQL.\n\n-   Click on **SQL Window** button.\n\n![](img03/image43.jpg){width=\"300\"}\n\nNotice that Query (Project layers) appears.\n\n![](img03/image44.jpg)\n\n-   Type the SQL below onto Query panel.\n\n![](img03/image45.jpg){width=\"350\"}\n\nYour screen should look similar to the screenshot below.\n\n![](img03/image46.jpg)\n\n-   When you are ready, click on **Execute** button.\n\nAfter a short while, the query results appears as shown below.\n\n![](img03/image47.jpg)\n\nNow you are going to add the query into Layers panel.\n\n-   Click on the check-box in front of **Load as new layer**.\n\nNotice that a sub-panel is added onto DB Manager dialog window.\n\n![](img03/image48.jpg)\n\n-   By default, the check-box in front of **Geometry column** is checked. Click on the check-box to un-check it. This is because our data table has no geometry.\n\n-   Lastly, click on **Load** button.\n\nNotice that a QueryLayer has been added into Layers panel.\n\n![](img03/image50.jpg){width=\"276\"}\n\nNow, we are going to save it into Geopackage.\n\n-   From Layers panel, right-click on *QueryLayer* then select **Export** -\\> **Save Features As** from the context menu.\n\n![](img03/image51.jpg)\n\nIn general the steps for saving *QeuryLayer* is rather similar to saving geospatial data into Geopackage except for **Geometry type**, **No Geometry** should be selected from the drop-down list.\n\n![](img03/image52.jpg){width=\"372\"}\n\n-   Lastly, click on **OK** button to run the process.\n\nWhen the operation completed, a new data layer called `TOTPOP2000` will be added into **Layers** panel as shown below.\n\n![](img03/image53.jpg){width=\"250\"}\n\n> DIY: Using the steps you had learned, remove `QueryLayer` from **Layer** panel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n",
