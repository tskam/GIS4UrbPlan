They are:\n\n-   Fire stations from Singapore Civil Defence Force, Ministry of Home Affairs. This data can be downloaded from data.gov.sg.\n-   Roads data from OpenStreetMap (OSM) data sets. OSM data sets can be downloaded from Geofabrik's free download [server](https://download.geofabrik.de/).\n\n**Note:** I recommend this download site instead of [bbbike](https://www.bbbike.org/) because I found out that the quality of the data provided by Geofabrik is better than bbbike.\n\n## Installing QNEAT3 plugin.\n\nBefore getting started, you need to install QNEAT3 plugin.\n\n-   From the menu bar, select **Plugins** -\\> **Manage and Install plugins**.\n\nPlugins dialog window appears.\n\n-   At the query, type **QNEAT3**.\n\nNotice that QNEAT3 appears on the search output list.\n\n-   Click on **QNEAT3**.\n\n-   Click on **Install Plugin** button.\n\nWhen the installation is completed, close the dialog box by\n\n-   click on **Close** button.\n\nIn order to activate the Iso-Area as Polygon/Contour algorithms you have to add the **matplotlib** library to your QGIS-Python installation. Depending on your operating system you may install matplotlib manually using the following options:\n\n### Windows:\n\nOpen the OSGeo4W shell that has been installed alongside QGIS.\n\n-   Click **Start** then type ***OSGeo4W Shell***, and hit **Enter** key.\n\n-   At the **OSGeo4W Shell**, type the command below.\n\n> python-qgis -m pip install matplotlib\n\n-   Press **Enter** key.\n-   When the installation is completed, restart QGIS3\n\n### macOS\n\n-   Open a terminal.\n\n-   Type the following command:\n\n> /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.x/bin/pip3.x install matplotlib\n\nNote: Replace the version number x according to your installation) into the terminal,\n\n-   Press **Enter** and confirm installation with *yes* when prompted\n\n-   Restart QGIS3\n\nAfter this installation, you are ready to use all QNEAT3 Algorithms.\n\nBefore using the plugin, you must at least read the concept and methods of [Iso-area](https://root676.github.io/IsoAreaAlgs.html) because it will be used in this hands-on exercise.\n\n## Start a new QGIS Project\n\n> DIY: Using the steps you had learned in previous hands-on exercise, start a new QGIS project. Save the project and give it a name (i.e. Hands-on_Ex11).\n\n**Reminder:** Ensure that svy21 projection system is used.\n\n## Data Preparation\n\n### Downloading the fire stations layer\n\n> DIY: Using the steps you had learned, perform the following steps:\n>\n> -   Download fire stations data from data.gov.sg and import it into QGIS.\n>\n> -   In data.gov.sg portal, fire station data set is in kml and geojson formats. Import the most **usable** format into QGIS as a GIS layer.\n>\n> -   Save the GIS layer into GeoPackage format. Name the output layer as `firestations`.\n\n**Be warn:** The original data is in **wgs84**. For the purpose of network analysis, the GIS data must be be in projected coordinates system (i.e. SVY21 for Singapore).\n\n### Extracting and preparing road network layer\n\nI can't emphasize enough the importance of a quality data preparation in GIS analysis. In this sub-section, you will use basic QGIS functions to perform the following data preparation tasks:\n\n-   selecting all roads features with the study area\n\n-   extracting appropriate road classes for the analysis, and\n\n-   updating speed values of the road feature classes.\n\nTable 1 below shows\n\n| Road feature class | Speed (km/h) |\n|--------------------|--------------|\n| motorway           | 90           |\n| motorway_link      | 50           |\n| primary            | 60           |\n| primary_link       | 60           |\n| residential        | 50           |\n| secondary          | 50           |\n| secondary_link     | 50           |\n| service            | 15           |\n| tertiary           | 40           |\n| tertiary_link      | 40           |\n| trunk              | 60           |\n| trunk_link         | 60           |\n| unclassified       | 15           |\n\n: Table 1: Road feature classes and their speeds\n\n#### Selecting all road network with the study area\n\n> DIY: Performing the following task by using appropriate QGIS function(s) you had learned from previous hands-on exercises.:\n>\n> -   import road data set of OSM into QGIS,\n>\n> -   extract the road network within Singapore mainland (excluding outer insland, Pulau Tekong and Pulau Ubi), and\n>\n> -   save the GIS layer into GeoPackage format. Call the layer `all_roads`.\n\n**Be warn:** The original data is in **wgs84**. For the purpose of network analysis, the road data must bein projected coordinates system (i.e. svy21 in Singapore).\n\n#### Extracting motor vehicle road network\n\n> DIY: Using appropriate QGIS function(s) you had learned from previous hands-on exercise, select road feature classes listed in Table 1 above from the `all_roads` layer. Save the GIS layer into GeoPackage format. Name the layer `roads`.\n\n**Reminder:** Remove all the source data from QGIS project before continue to the next section.\n\n#### Updating speed values of the road feature classes\n\nIn order to derive drive-time service areas from a road network, the road data must have a field containing the speed of each network feature class. The steps below will be used to update the speed field of road layer.\n\n-   From **Layers** panel, right-click on Roads.\n\n-   Select **Open Attribute Table** from the context menu.\n\nThe attribute table of Roads layer appears.\n\n![](img11/image2.jpg)\n\n-   From the menu bar of the attribute table, click on **Open field calculator** icon ![](img11/image3.jpg).\n\nThe Field calculator dialog window appears.\n\nSince we are going to create a new field called `speed`,\n\n-   Click on the check-box in front of **Create a new field**.\n-   For **Output field name**, type `speed`.\n-   For **Output field typ**e, select Integer (32bit) from the drop-down list.\n-   At the Expression panel, type as shown below.\n\n![](img11/image4.jpg){width=\"410\"}\n\n**Best practice**: check the Preview below the Expression panel to ensure that the syntax are valid.\n\n-   Click on **OK** button to run the operation.\n\nUpon completion, the Field calculator dialog window will close by itself.\n\nNotice that a new attribute field called speed has been added into the attribute table of Roads layer.\n\n![](img11/image5.jpg)\n\nLastly, remember to save the changes before ending the process.\n\n-   From the icon menu of the attribute table of Roads, click on **Toggle editing mode** icon ![](img11/image6.jpg).\n\nThe **Stop Editin**g dialog window appears.\n\n![](img11/image7.jpg){width=\"291\"}\n\n-   Click on **Save** button to save the changes.\n\n-   Close the attribute table of Roads layer.\n\n## Delineating Network Service Areas with NEAT3 Plugin\n\nIn this section, you will learn how to delineating network service areas by using QGIS Network Analysis Toolbox (QNEAT3) plugin.\n\n### Buffering method\n\nBuffering is one of the most commonly used GIS method to delineating service area. It is based on the concept of Euclidean distance (as-the-crow-flies). In general, this is done by creating a buffer zone with a certain radius (i.e. 5 kilometeres) around a target location.\n\nFor the purpose of this hands-on exercise, Bukit Batok Fire Station will be used as the target location.\n\n> DIY: Using the steps you had learned, select Bukit Batok Fire Station.\n\nYour screen shout look similar to the screenshot below.\n\n![](img11/image16.jpg)\n\nNotice that the selected target fire station is highlighted in yellow.\n\nNext, we will delineate the 5-km service area of Bukit Batok Fire Station by using buffering method of QGIS.\n\n-   From QGIS's menu bar, select **Vector** -\\> **Geoprocessing Tool**s -\\> **Buffer**.\n\nThe Buffer dialog windows appears.\n\n-   For **Input layer**, select firestations from the drop-down list.\n\n-   For **Distance**, type *5000*. Make sure that the unit of measurement is in *meter*s.\n\n-   For Segments, type *100* for smoother buffer zone.\n\nThe completed Buffer dialog window should look similar to the screenshot below.\n\n![](img11/image8.jpg)\n\nWhen you are ready,\n\n-   Click on **Run** button.\n\nIn the blink of an eye, a temporary layer called `Buffered` is added into Layers panel and display on QGIS view window as shown below.\n\n![5-km buffer around Bukit Batok Fire Station](img11/image9.jpg)\n\nDespite its popularity, using straight-line distances to delineate a service area can be rather misleading is real world geography. This is because the commonly used fire engines need to travel along a road in order to reach the fire incident location rather than flying like a crow where by the speed is almost constant.\n\n![](img11/image17.jpg)\n\n### Shortest network distance method\n\nA more realistic approach to delineating service area is by using network distance. By and large, there are two approaches, namely shortest network distance and fastest network distance. In this sub-section, shortest network distance approach will be used. You will learn how to delineate service area using fastest distance approach in the next sub-section.\n\nTo delineate service area using shortest distance approach, Iso-Area as Polygons (from Layer) function of QNEAT3 will be used.\n\n-   From QGIS's menu bar, select **Processing** -\\> **Toolbox**.\n\nThe Processing Toolbox panel appears.\n\n-   Select **QNEATS3** -\\> **Iso-Areas** -\\> **Iso-Area as Polygons (from Layer)**.\n\n![](img11/image18.jpg){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"278\"}\n\nThe **Iso-Area as Polygons (From Layer)** dialog window appears.\n\n-   For **Vector layer representing network**, select *Roads* from the drop-down list.\n\n-   For **Start Points**, select *firestations* from the drop-down list.\n\nNotice that both GIS layers are in projected coordinates system (i.e. EPSG:3414 which is svy21).\n\n-   Keep the check-box in front of **Selected features** only checked.\n\n-   For **Unique Point ID field**, select *Name* from the drop-down list.\n\n-   For **Size of Iso-Area (distance or time value)**, type *5000*.\n\n-   For **Contour Interval**, type *5000*.\n\n-   For **Path type to calculate**, select *Shortest Path (distance optimization)* from the drop-down list.\n\n-   For **Direction field**, select *oneway* from the drop-down list.\n\n-   For **Value for forward direction**, type *F*.\n\n-   For **Value for backward direction**, type *T.*\n\n-   For **Value for both directions**, type *B*.\n\nKeep the rest of the entries as default.\n\nYour screen should look similar to the screenshot below.\n\n![](img11/image10.jpg)\n\nWhen you are ready to run the function,\n\n-   click on the **Run** button.\n\nThe process involves massive computation and will take awhile to complete (usually less than 5 mins in a standard 64bit machine).\n\nWhen the process completed, two temporary layers namely: `Output Polygon` and `Output Interpolation` will be added onto Layers panel and display on QGIS View window.\n\n![5000-km shortest service area of Bukit Batok Fire Station](img11/image11.jpg)\n\nThe `Output Interpolation` layer is a raster layer created using triangular irregular network (TIN). On the other hand, `Output Polygon` layer is a polygon feature showing the 5-km service area of Bukit Batok Fire Station by road network.\n\nThe `Output Polygon` is popularly know as isochrone. It is originated from Greek: *iso* means \"the same\" and *chronos* means \"time\".\n\n### Fastest distance method\n\nInstead of using distance to compute the shortest path, the fasted distance approach uses the speed to delineate the service area of a target location, in our case, Bukit Batok Fire Station. In this sub-section, you are going learn how to delineate a 5-min service area by using QNEAT3.\n\n-   From QGIS's menu bar, select **Processing** -\\> **Toolbox**.\n\nThe Processing Toolbox panel appears.\n\n-   Select **QNEATS3** -\\> **Iso-Areas** -\\> **Iso-Area as Polygons (from Layer)**.\n\nThe Iso-Area as Polygons (From Layer) dialog window appears.\n\n-   For **Vector layer representing network**, select *Roads* from the drop-down list.\n\n-   For **Start Points**, select *firestations* from the drop-down list.\n\n-   Keep the check-box in front of **Selected features** only checked.\n\n-   For **Unique Point ID field**, select *Name* from the drop-down list.\n\n-   For **Size of Iso-Area (distance or time value)**, type *300*.\n\n-   For **Contour Interval**, type *300*.\n\n-   For **Path type to calculate**, select *Fastest Path (time optimization)* from the drop-down list.\n\n-   For **Direction field**, select *oneway* from the drop-down list.\n\n-   For **Value for forward direction**, type *F*.\n\n-   For **Value for backward direction**, type *T*.\n\n-   For **Value for both directions**, type *B*.\n\n-   For **Speed field**, select *speed* from the drop-down list.\n\nKeep the rest of the entries as default.\n\nYour screen should look similar to the screenshot below.\n\n![](img11/image12.jpg)\n\nWhen you are ready to run the operation,\n\n-   click on **Run** button.\n\nAgain, the process will take some time to complete. Usually not going to take more than 5 minutes for a standard 64bit machine.\n\nWhen the operation completed, two new temporary layers will be added onto Layer panel and display on QGIS View window. Similar to Shortest network distance methods, one of the output is called `Output Polygon` which shows the 5-minutes drive-time service area of Bukit Batok Fire Station as shown in figure below.\n\n![5-minutes drive-time service area of Bukit Batok Fire Station](img11/image13.jpg)\n\n## Comparing Buffer, Shortest and Fastest Service Area\n\nFigure below comparing the buffer service area and shortest distance service area.\n\n![](img11/image14.jpg)\n\nFigure below compares the difference between buffer, shortest distance and fastest distance of Bukit Batok Fire Station.\n\n![](img11/image15.jpg)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n",
