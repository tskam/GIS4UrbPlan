In this hands-on exercise, you will learn how to perform raster-based GIS analysis also popularly known as mapthematics by using QGIS.\n\nBy the end of this session, you will be able to:\n\n-   create a raster data from a vector GIS layer,\n\n-   extract raster layer,\n\n-   georeference a raster layer and\n\n-   derive proximity layer(s) by using distance function of QGIS.\n\n## Data Preparation\n\nTwo GIS data are available for the analysis. They are:\n\n-   Location of primary, secondary, mixed and JC (i.e. Education).\n-   Outline map of Singapore (i.e. CoastalOutline).\n\n### Add the GIS data into QGIS Project\n\nBefore you can start to perform any analysis, you need to start a new QGIS project.\n\n> DIY: Using the steps you had learned from last lesson, add the Education and CoastalOutline into the newly created QGIS project.\n\n### Using attribute query to select a subset from a master layer\n\nThe Education layer consists of locations of education institutions such as primary schools, secondary school, mixed and JC. We are only interested on education institutions that belong to primary and secondary schools.\n\n> DIY: Using the steps you had learned from last lesson, extract and save the primary and secondary schools in two separate GIS vector layers.\n\nYour screen should look similar to the figure below.\n\n![](img06/image1.jpg)\n\n## Raster Data Modelling\n\nIn this exercise, you will learn how to model raster data. The exercise focusses on how to rasterise a vector GIS data layer using QGIS geoprocessing functions.\n\n### Editing attribute data\n\nIn this section, you will create a new field in the attribute table of a vector GIS data and update values of the newly created field. You will name the field as POI_CODE. The data type of this data field is integer.\n\n-   At **Browser** panel, right-click on the `Primary Schools` layer.\n-   Select **Open Attribute Table** from the context menu.\n\nThe Attribute table dialog window of Primary Schools appears.\n\n![](img06/image2.jpg)\n\n-   From the icon bar of the Attribute table window, click on the **Open field calculator** icon.\n\nThe Field calculator dialog window appears.\n\n-   For **Output file** name, type *POI_CODE*.\n-   For **Output filed** type, select **Whole number (integer)** from the drop-down list.\n-   For **Output field**, change to *3*.\n-   At the **Expression** pane, type *1*.\n\nThe Field calculator dialog window should look similar to the figure below now.\n\n![](img06/image3.jpg){width=\"361\"}\n\n• Click on the **OK** button.\n\nNotice that a new field called POI_CODE has been added into the Attribute table of Primary School. Also notice that the POI_CODE values are 1s.\n\n![](img06/image4.jpg)\n\nYou will end the editing process now.\n\n-   At the icon menu of Attribute table window, click on the **Toggle editing** mode icon.\n\n![](img06/image5.jpg)\n\nThe Stop editing dialog window appears.\n\n![](img06/image6.jpg){width=\"236\"}\n\n• Click on the **Save** button.\n\nNow, you will close the Attribute table window of Primary Schools layer.\n\n-   At the Attribute table of Primary Schools, click on the **Close** button.\n\n## Rasterising a vector GIS data layer\n\nIn QGIS, several functions can be used to rasterise a vector GIS layer into a raster GIS layer such as Rasterize function of GDAL and the Shape to Grid function of SAGA. In this section, you will learn how to rasterise the primary school vector GIS layer into a raster GIS layer using the Shapes to grid function of SAGA because we found that it is more effective.\n\n-   From the menu bar of QGIS, select **Processing** -\\> **Toolbox**.\n\nThe Processing Toolbox pane appears at the right hand side of the Map View window\n\n![](img06/image7.jpg){width=\"373\"}\n\n-   From the Geoprocessing Toolbox, click on **GDAL** -\\> **Vector conversion** -\\> **Rasterize (vector to raster)**.\n\n![](img06/image8.jpg){width=\"369\"}\n\nThe **Rasterize (Vactor to raster)** dialog window appears.\n\n-   For **Input layer**, select `Primary School` from the drop-down list.\n-   For **Field to use for a burn-in value** \\[optional\\], select `POI_CODE` from the drop-down list.\n-   For **Output raster size unit**, select **Georeferenced units** from the dropdown list.\n-   For **Width/Horizontal resolution**, type *50*.\n-   For **Height/Vertical resolution**, type *50*.\n-   For **Output extent**, select **Calculate from layer** -\\> **CostalOutline** from the drop-down list.\n\n![](img06/image9.jpg){width=\"405\"}\n\nYour screen should look similar to the figure below.\n\n![](img06/image10.jpg)\n\n-   Click on the **Run** button.\n\nAfter a few seconds, a new raster layer called the Grid will be added onto the Browser panel.\n\n![](img06/image11.jpg){width=\"247\"}\n\n-   From **Rasterize** dialog window, click on **Close** button to close the dialog window.\n\nLet us take a good look at this newly created raster layer. According to the legend, the primary school cells will be coded as 1 and the remaining grid cells will be coded as no data.\n\n> DIY: Use the Identify tool of QGIS to validate if the data layer has been coded correctly.\n\n> Quiz: What is the value of the dark cell in Grid layer: \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n> Quiz: What is the value of the white cell in Grid layer: \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n> DIY: Using the step you learned from previous exercise, save the output raster into GeoPackage format. Call the layer `PriSch_ras`.\n\n## Accessibility Modelling using Raster-based GIS Analysis\n\nIn this section, you will learn the basic concept of accessibility from geospatial perspective. You will also learn how to use appropriate raster GIS analyse function and mapping techniques to analyse and visualize accessibility maps.\n\n## Creating proximity layer using raster GIS analysis\n\nIn this section, you will learn how to perform proximity analysis and derived distance layer using raster GIS analysis function. You will use the raster version of the primary school layer as the target layer in the analysis instead of the vector version of the primary schools layer (Do you know why?)\n\nYou will perform the task using the rasterize function of Geospatial Data Abstraction Library (GDAL), a library for reading and writing raster geospatial data formats, and is released under the permissive X/MIT style free software license by the Open Source Geospatial Foundation. As a library, it presents a single abstract data model to the calling application for all supported formats. It may also be built with a variety of useful command-line utilities for data translation and processing (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDAL).\n\n-   From the **Processing Toolbox** panel, navigate to **GDAL Analysis** -\\> **Proximity (raster distance)**.\n\n![](img06/image12.jpg){width=\"411\"}\n\n-   Double-click on **Proximity (raster distance)**.\n\nThe Proximity (raster distance) dialog window appears.\n\n-   For **Input layer**, select Rasterize from the drop-down list.\n-   For **A list of pixel values in ......**, type *1*.\n\n> Quiz: Explain why value 1 is used?\n\n-   For **Distance units**, select **Georeferenced coordinates** from the drop-down list.\n-   For the other three options, keep as default (e.g. -1).\n-   For **Proximity Map**, select *Save to a temporary* file from the context menu.\n\nThe **Proximity (raster distance)** dialog window should look similar to the figure below.\n\n![](img06/image13.jpg)\n\nYou are ready to run the function.\n\n-   Click on the **Run** button.\n\nAfter a few seconds a new layer called Proximity Map will be added into the **Browse** panel and display as a raster layer on the **Display** window.\n\n![](img06/image14.jpg)\n\nBefore we continue, let us close **Proximity** dialog window.\n\n-   From the **Proximity** dialog window, click on **Close** button.\n\nLet us explore the **Proximity Map** layer.\n\n-   Display the Primary School layer.\n\nYour screen should look similar to the figure below.\n\n![](img06/image15.jpg)\n\n-   Zoom into a `Primary School` layer.\n\n![](img06/image16.jpg)\n\nYour screen should look similar to the figure below.\n\n![](img06/image17.jpg)\n\nIn order to visualise the grid values properly, we need to stretch the cell values.\n\n-   From the Layer panel, right-click on Stretch Using Current Extent.\n\n![](img06/image18.jpg){width=\"412\"}\n\nNow, a clear grid layer appears on the Map View window.\n\n![](img06/image19.jpg)\n\nNow, you will examine the value of the grid.\n\n-   Make sure that `Proximity Map` layer is active.\n-   Hover the mouse over the primary school point.\n-   Click on the grid.\n\nThe Identify Results dialog window shows that the value of the selected grid is 0.\n\n![](img06/image20.jpg){width=\"379\"}\n\nNext, you will examine the value of the grid immediately next to the primary school.\n\n-   Hover the mouse over the grid next to the primary school point.\n-   Click on the grid.\n\nThe Identify Results window reveals that the value of the selected grid is 50.\n\n![](img06/image21.jpg){width=\"373\"}\n\n> DIY: Using the skills you had learned from previous section, save the Proximity Map into Geopackage format.\n\n## Terrain Analysis and Visualisation\n\nElevation and related terrain variables are important in most people lives. Terrain determines the natural availability and location of surface water, and hence soil moisture and drainage. Terrain also strongly influences the location and nature of transportation networks, and the cost and methods of house and road construction. Prior to the introduction of GIS, the modelling and analysis of terrain data was a very mathematically demanding process which was usually only performed by geoscience and mapping science specialists. Today, modern GIS tool such as QGIS has made terrain modelling, anaysis and mapping relatively easy to perform by casual data analysts. In this section, you will learn how to:\n\n-   download Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data from online open source repository,\n-   mosaic multiple DEM data into one,\n-   extract DEM for a study area,\n-   compute terrain parameters such as slope, aspect, and hillshading, and\n-   perform visibility analysis.\n\n### Downloading DEM data from USGS Earth Explorer\n\nThere are four DEM data can be obtained free of charge.

We can hardly see anything.\n\n-   At the lower right corner of the View window, select 1:50000 from the drop down list.\n\n![](img06/image43.jpg){width=\"285\"}\n\nYour screen should look similar to the screenshot below.\n\n![](img06/image44.jpg)\n\n-   From the **Layers** panel, right-click on *Merged*, then select **Stretch Using Current Extent** from the context menu.\n\n![](img06/image45.jpg)\n\nNow, you can see *Merged* layer clearly.\n\n![](img06/image46.jpg)\n\n> DIY: Using the method you had learned, display the view with full extend.\n\nYour screen should look similar to the screenshot below.\n\n![](img06/image47.jpg)\n\n### Extracting raster data layer\n\nNotice that Merged layer include part of West Malaysia and Batam Island of Indonesia. Next, you will learn how to extract DEM raster layer with Singapore.\n\nFirst, we are going to select area within Singapore mainly from Coastal Outline layer.\n\n-   From the icon bar, click on **Select Feature(s)** icon.\n\n![](img06/image48.jpg){width=\"353\"}\n\n-   Hover the mouse at the centre of Singapore island then click on the left mouse button to select.\n\nYour screen should look similar to the screenshot below.\n\n![](img06/image49.jpg)\n\nNext, we are going to use the raster data wrangling tool to extract DEM layer falls within Singapore main island.\n\n-   From the menu bar, select **Raster** -\\> **Extraction** -\\> **Clip Raster by Mask Layer**.\n\n![](img06/image50.jpg){width=\"469\"}\n\n**Clip Raster by Mask Layer** dialog window appears.\n\n-   For **Input layer**, select *Merged* from the drop-down list.\n\n-   For **Mask layer**, select *CostalOutline* from the drop-down list.\n\n-   Because we are interested to extract only area falls within Singapore main island, it is important to click on the checkbox in front of **Select features only**.\n\n![](img06/image51.jpg)\n\nYour screen should look similar to the screenshot below.\n\n-   Keep the rest as default, then click on Run button to execute the process.\n\n![](img06/image52.jpg){width=\"448\"}\n\n-   Close the dialog window if the process completed without any error.\n\nNotice that a new layer called *Clipped* has been added on **Layers** panel and display on **View** window.\n\n### Reprojecting raster GIS layer\n\nThe original DEM rater data are in wgs84 geographic coordinate system. Hence, before we can save the clipped DEM raster layer into Geopackage format, we need to reproject the raster GIS layer into svy21 Project Coodrinate System (i.e. EPSG 3414)\n\n-   From menu bar, click on Raster -\\> Projection -\\> Warp (Reproject).\n\n![](img06/image53a.jpg){width=\"400\"}\n\nThe **Wrap(Reproject)** dialog window appears.\n\n-   For **Input layer**, select *Clipped (mask) \\[EPSG: 4326\\]* from the drop-down menu.\n-   For **Source CRS\\[optional\\]**, select *EPSG:3414 - WGS 84* from the selection list.\n-   For **Target CRS\\[optional\\]**, select *Project CRS: EPSG: 3414 - SVY21 / Singapore TM* from the list.\n-   For **Resampling method to us**e, select *Nearest Neighbour*.\n\nYour screen should look similar to the screen shot below.\n\n![](img06/image53b.jpg)\n\n-   Keep the rest of the setting as default, click on Run button to execute the process.\n\n![](img06/image53c.jpg)\n\n-   Close the dialog window if the process completed without any error.\n\nNotice that a new virtual layer called Reproject has been added onto the layer panel.\n\n![](img06/image53d.jpg){width=\"400\"}\n\n> DIY: Using the steps you had learned, save the Reprojected virtual layer into Geopackage. Call the raster layer DEM.\n\n> DIY: Using the steps you had learned, remove the raw DEM layers, temporaly *Merged*, *Clipped* and Reprojected layers from QGIS.\n\n### Visibility Analysis with Raster GIS\n\nVisibility analysis is a widely used function in GIS. It identifies areas that can or cannot be seen from a single (or a set of) viewpoint(s). The clearly visible parts of an observer's surrounding area, as well as hidden parts, may thus be evaluated.\\\nVisibility analysis proves useful when selecting the best or optimal locations in urban studies, e.g., placement of various facilities which should be made visible (nice, interesting places) or those which should be rather hidden (e.g. wind turbines). Apart from architecture, visibility analysis is useful for tourism purposes, archaeology, communication engineering, and may be highly serviceable in the military.\n\nIn this section, you will learn how to perform visibility between two Satellite Earth Stations by using QGIS.\n\n#### Importing the Satellite Earth Station GIS data\n\nFirst, you need to import the Satellite Earth Station shapefile into QGIS.\n\n> DIY: Using the steps you had learned, import Satellite_Earth_Station shapefile from shapefile folder into QGIS.\n\nYour screen should look similar to the screenshot below.\n\n![](img06/image54.jpg)\n\n#### Installing Visual Analysis plugin\n\nNext, you will install Visibility Analysis plugin.\n\n-   From the menu bar, select **Plugins** -\\> **Manage and Install Plugin**.\n\n![](img06/image55.jpg){width=\"347\"}\n\nPlugin dialog window appears.\n\n![](img06/image56.jpg)\n\n-   At **Search** bar, type *Visibilit*y.\n\n-   Click on Visibility Analysis then click on Install Plugin button.\n\nWhen the installation completed,\n\n-   Click on **Close** button to close the dialog window.\n\n#### Creating viewpoint layer\n\nBefore we can perform visibility analysis, a viewpoint layer must be created.\n\n-   From the menu bar, select **Processing** -\\> **Toolbox**.\n\n![](img06/image57.jpg)\n\nNotice that **Processing Toolbox** panel is added on the right of the **View** window.\n\n![](img06/image58.jpg)\n\n-   At the **Processing Toolbox** panel, click on the black triangle in front **Visibility Analysis** to expand the menu options.\n\n-   Then, click on the triangle next to **Create viewpoints** and double-click on **Create viewpoints** tool.\n\n![](img06/image59.jpg){width=\"307\"}\n\n**Create Viewpoints** dialog window appears.\n\n-   For **Observer location(s)**, select *Satellite_Earth_Station* from the drop-down list.\n\n-   For **Digital elevation model**, select *DEM* from the drop-down list.\n\n-   For **Radius of analysis, meters**, type *5000*.\n\n-   For **Observer height, meters**, type *10*.\n\nYour screen should look similar to the screenshot below.\n\n![](img06/image60.jpg)\n\n-   When you are ready to run the function, click on **Run** button.\n\n-   When the process ended without any error message, click on **Close** button to close the dialog window.\n\nNotice that a new temporary layer called *Output* layer has been added in the Layers panel and display on View window,\n\n![](img06/image61.jpg)\n\nLet us examine the content of the attribute table of this newly derived GIS layer.\n\n-   From the **Layers** panel, right-click on *Output layer* then select **Open Attribute Table** from the context menu.\n\nAttribute table of Output layer appears.\n\n![](img06/image62.jpg){width=\"1235\"}\n\nNotice that two new fields have been added into the attribute table of Output layer. They are *observ_hgt* and *radius*. Also note that the field name *POI_ID* has changed to *ID*.\n\n> DIY: Using the steps you had learned, save Output layer into Geopackage format. Name the layer *Viewpoints*. Also, remember to remove *Output layer* from **Layers** panel.\n\nNow we are ready to perform visibility analysis by using **Viewshed** function of Visibility Analysis plugin.\n\n-   From Processing toolbox, click on **Visibility analysis** -\\> **Analysis** -\\> **Viewshed**.\n\n![](img06/image63.jpg){width=\"270\"}\n\nViewshed dialog window appears.\n\n-   For **Analysis type**, select *Binary viewshed* from the drop-down list.\n\nThis option will output a raster with values 0 and 1. 0 indicates not visible locations and 1 indicates visible locations.\n\n-   For **Observer location(s)**, select *Viewpoints* from the drop-down list.\n\n-   For **Digital elevation model**, select *DEM* from the drop-down list,\n\n**Be warn:** It is important to ensure that the CRS of both the Observer location(s) layer and Digital elevation layer are the same.\n\n-   For **Combining multiple outputs**, select *Addition* from the drop-down list because multiple viewpoints are used.\n\n![](img06/image64.jpg)\n\n-   When you are ready to run the function, click on **Run** button.\n\nWhen the process ended, read the process log to ensure that the process has been completed without any error.\n\n-   Click on Close button to close the dialog window.\n\nNotice that a new binary raster layer called *Output file* has been added into Layers panel and display on View window.\n\n![](img06/image65.jpg)\n\n> DIY: Using the steps you had learned, save *Output file* temporary layer into Geopackage format. Name the layer *Visibility layer*.\n\n#### Symbolising raster layer\n\nBy default Visibility layer is shaded with gray colour. Now, we are going to symbolise Visibility layer.\n\n-   From **Layers** panel, right-click on *Visibility* and select **Properties** from the context menu.\n\nYou screen should look similar to the screenshot below.\n\n![](img06/image80.jpg)\n\n-   For **Render type**, select **Paletted/Unique values** from the drop-down list.\n\n![](img06/image81.jpg){width=\"264\"}\n\n-   Click on **Classify** button.\n\n![](img06/image82.jpg)\n\nNotice that the colour palette changed.\n\n![](img06/image83.jpg)\n\n-   Click on Apply button to update the changes.\n\n-   When it is done, click on OK button to close the dialog window.\n\nYou screen should look similar to the screenshot below.\n\n![](img06/image84.jpg)\n\nThe areas shaded in green are location not visible from both Satellite towers. The areas shaded in red are locations observed by at least one of the satellite tower. Lastly, areas shaded in purple-blue (with value 2) are locations visible by both satellite towers.\n\n> DIY: By applying appropriate symbolising methods for raster layer you had learned, design a cartography quality view look similar to the screenshot below.\n\n![](img06/image85.jpg)\n\n### Profile Analysis\n\nAnother useful GIS analysis using DEM is calling profile analysis. Profiles or more appropriately called topographic profiles are cross-sectional views **showing elevation along a line**. In other words, if you could slice the Earth along that line and view it from the side, that two-dimensional graph displaying height would be a topographic profile.\n\nFigure below shows a cross-section profile view of Singapore Island Country Club. The red line on the map is the cross-section line. The line graph below the map is popularly known as profile graph whereby the x-axis is distance between the starting point and the end point of the cross-section line. The y-axis, on-the-other-hand, shows the elevation heights of the cross-section line. The unit of measurement is in meter.\n\n![](img06/image66.jpg)\n\nTopographic profiles have different terms to describe them -- vertical profiles, cross-section graphs, or 2D elevation charts. They can help you assess the difficulty of a trail or evaluate the feasibility of placing a rail line along a given route.\n\nProfile analysis have different uses in engineering (like fiber optic cable design), hydrology (slope along a channel with a rise-over-run), and land use planning (ski slope design).\n\nIn this section of the hands-on exercise, you will learn how to perform profile analysis **Profile tool** plugin of QGIS.\n\n#### Installing Profile tool plugin\n\nFirst, let us install Profile tool plugin if you have yet to do so.\n\n-   From the menu bar, select **Plugins** -\\> **Manage and Install Plugin**.\n\n![](img06/image55.jpg){width=\"347\"}\n\nPlugin dialog window appears.\n\n-   At **Search** bar, type *Profile*.\n\n![](img06/image67.jpg)\n\n-   Click on **Profile tool** then click on **Install Plugin b**utton.\n\nWhen the installation completed,\n\n-   Click on **Close** button to close the dialog window.\n\n#### Analysing and visualising profile of a straight line\n\nLet say we are interested to analyse the topographic profile of Singapore Island Country Club.\n\n-   From **Browser** panel, click to expand **XYZ Tiles**.\n\n![](img06/image68.jpg){width=\"284\"}\n\n-   Double click on OSM.\n\nNotice that OSM image layer is added on View window.\n\n-   Zoom and navigate to Singapore Island Country Club.\n\nYour View window should look similar to the screenshot below.\n\n![](img06/image69.jpg)\n\nNext, we will launch **Profile tool**.\n\n-   From menu bar, click on ![](img06/image70.jpg){width=\"15\" height=\"16\"} button.\n\nProfile dialog window appears.\n\n![](img06/image71.jpg)\n\nNext we are going to draw a straight line across the gulf course as shown below.\n\n![](img06/image72.jpg)\n\n-   Hover over the lower position on the line, then click on the left hand mouse once.\n\n-   Hover over the upper position of the line, double click to end the digitising.\n\n-   From the Layers panel, click on DEM to make it active.\n\n![](img06/image73.jpg){width=\"202\"}\n\n-   From **Profile** dialog window, click on **Add Layer** button.\n\n![](img06/image74.jpg)\n\nNotice that DEM is added onto Profile dialog and a Profile plot appears.\n\n![](img06/image75.jpg)\n\nNotice that by default, the profile plot is interactive. When you hover the mouse on the profile plot as shown below, the corresponding location will be shown as a little red dot along the line-of-sight on the map view.\n\n![](img06/image76.jpg)\n\n#### Analysing and visualising profile along a path\n\nAnother common application of profile analysis is to visualising the profile along a path such as golfing track in the following use case.\n\n> DIY: Using the steps you had learned, import OSM_pathGIS data from shapefile folder.\n\nYour screen should look similar to the screenshot below.\n\n![](img06/image77.jpg)\n\n-   Next click on Profile tool icon to launch the dialog window if necessary.\n\n-   From the lower right panel of Profile dialog window, select **Selected polyline** from the drop-down list.\n\n![](img06/image78.jpg){width=\"396\"}\n\n-   From **Layer** panel, click on `OSM_path` to make if active.\n-   Hover the mouse over any one of the path and click on the left-hand button to select the path.\n\nThe profile of the path will be plotted as shown in the screenshot below.\n\n![](img06/image79.jpg)\n\nYou can save the profile plot as image file for reporting purpose.\n\n-   At the lower right corner of **Profile** pane, click on **Save as** button.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n",
