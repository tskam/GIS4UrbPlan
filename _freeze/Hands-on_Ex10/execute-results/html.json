It is a key element in urban planning and management since it is a direct expression of mobility either in terms of people, freight, or information within a city or between cities.\n\nWell-developed and efficient urban transport systems offer high accessibility levels, while less-developed ones have lower levels of accessibility. Thus, accessibility is linked with an array of economic and social opportunities.\n\nAll locations are not equal because some are more accessible than others, which implies **inequalities**. Thus, accessibility is a proxy for **spatial inequalities**.\n\nIn this hands-on exercise, you will gain hands-on experience on using both build in and plug-in network analysis functions of QGIS to derive accessibility indexes. By the end of this hands-on exercise, you will be able to:\n\n-   derive hexagon layer,\n-   extract, clean and process network data from roads layer of OSM data, and\n-   performing network accessibility by using network analysis tools of QNEAT plug-in.\n\n## Setting the scene\n\n### The Task\n\nIn this hands-on exercise, you are tasked to derive an accessibility to eldercare centre map of Singapore.\n\n### The Data\n\nThree major data sets will be used in this hands-on exercise. They are:\n\n-   Master Plan 2014 Subzone Boundary from URA. This data can be downloaded from data.gov.sg.\n-   Eldercare services from Ministry of Social and Family Development. This data can be downloaded from data.gov.sg.\n-   Roads data from OpenStreetMap (OSM) data sets. OSM data sets can be downloaded from Geofabrik's free download [server](https://download.geofabrik.de/).\n\n**Note:** I recommend this download site instead of [bbbike](https://www.bbbike.org/) because I found out that the quality of the data provided by Geofabrik is better than bbbike.\n\n## Data Preparation\n\n### Start a new QGIS Project\n\n> DIY: Using the steps you had learned in previous hands-on exercise, start a new QGIS project. Save the project and give it a name (i.e. Hands-on_Ex10).\n\n**Reminder:** Ensure that svy21 projection system is used.\n\n### Preparing base layer for the study area\n\n> DIY: Download Master Plan 2014 Subzone Boundary from data.gov.sg and import it into QGIS. Then, save the GIS layer into GeoPackage format. Name the output layer as `mpsz2014`.\n\n### Preparing eldercare layer\n\n> DIY: Download eldercare services data from data.gov.sg and import it into QGIS (Ideally, the shapefile version should be used). Then, save the GIS layer into GeoPackage format. Name the output layer as `eldercare`.\n\n### Extracting and preparing road network layer\n\n#### Selecting all road network with the study area\n\n> DIY: Using appropriate QGIS function(s) you had learned from previous hands-on exercise, clip the road network with Singapore mainland (excluding outer insland, Pulau Tekong and Pulau Ubi). Save the GIS layer into GeoPackage format. Call the layer `all_roads`.\n\n### Extracting motor vehicle road network\n\n> DIY: Using appropriate QGIS function(s) you had learned from previous hands-on Exercise, extract motor vechicle road network (i.e. motorway, motorway_link, primary, primary_link, secondary, secondary_link, tertiary, tertiary_link, residential, trunk and trunk_link) from the all_roads layer. Save the GIS layer into GeoPackage format. Name the layer `roads`.\n\n**Be warn:** The original data is in **wgs84**. For the purpose of network analysis, all network should be in projected coordinates system.\n\n**Reminder:** Remove all the source data from QGIS project before continue to the next section.\n\n## Analytical Hexagon\n\nIn GIS analysis, regularly shaped grids is used for many reasons such as normalizing geography for mapping or to mitigate the issues of using irregularly shaped polygons created arbitrarily (such as county boundaries or block groups that have been created from a political process). Regularly shaped grids can only be comprised of equilateral triangles, squares, or hexagons, as these three polygon shapes are the only three that can tessellate (repeating the same shape over and over again, edge to edge, to cover an area without gaps or overlaps) to create an evenly spaced grid.\n\n![](img09/image1.png)\n\nThough the square (fishnet) grid is the predominantly used shape type in GIS analysis and thematic mapping, there are ways in which hexagons may be better suited for your analysis based on the nature of your question.\n\nHexagons reduce sampling bias due to edge effects of the grid shape, this is related to the low perimeter-to-area ratio of the shape of the hexagon. A circle has the lowest ratio but cannot tessellate to form a continuous grid. Hexagons are the most circular-shaped polygon that can tessellate to form an evenly spaced grid.\n\n![](img09/image2.png){width=\"55%\"}\n\n### Creating hexagon layer\n\nNow, we are going to create a hexagon layer by using `mpsz` layer as the based. The hexagon distance is 250m.\n\n-   From the menu bar, select **Vector** -\\> **Research Tools** -\\> **Create Grids**.\n\n**Create Grids** dialog window appears.\n\n-   For **Grid type:** select *Hexagon (Polygon)* from the drop down list.\n\n![](img09/image1.jpg){width=\"35%\"}\n\n-   For **Grid extend:**, select *Calculate from Layer* -\\> `mpsz`\n\n![](img09/image2.jpg){width=\"55%\"}\n\n-   For **Horizontal spacing**, type *500*.\n-   For **Vertical spacing**, type *500*.\n\n> Question: Do you know why 500 is used?\n\n-   For **Grid CRS**, make sure that *EPSG 3414* is used.\n\nWhen you are ready to run the process,\n\n-   Click on **Run** button.\n\n**Reminder:** Read the Log before closing the dialog window.\n\n-   Click on **Close** button.\n\nNotice that a new temporary layer called `Grid` is added on the Layer pane and display on Map window.\n\n![](img09/image3.jpg)\n\n### Editing the hexagon layer\n\n> DIY: Using appropriate QGIS functions, edit the temporary `Grid` layer until it looks similar to the screenshot below.\n\n![](img09/image4.jpg)\n\n### Saving the hexagon layer\n\n> DIY: Using the steps you had learned in previous hands-on exercise, save the edited `Grid` layer into GeoPackage format. Give the layer a name (i.e. `hexagon`)\n\nBefore you move on to the next section, remember to remove the temporary `Grid` layer.\n\n### Computing hexagon centroid\n\nIn general, network analysis required the demand in a point feature. Hexagon, on the other hand, is a polygon feature. In order to meet the analysis need, we will compute the centroids of the hexagons.\n\n-   From the menu bar, select **Vector** -\\> **Geometry Tools** -\\> **Centroids**.\n\n**Centroids** dialog window appears.\n\n-   For **Input layer**, select *hexagon* from the drop-down list.\n\nWhen you are ready to run the process,\n\n-   Click on **Run** button.\n\n**Reminder:** Read the log before closing.\n\n-   Click on **Close** button.\n\nNotice that a new temporary layer called Centroid is added onto Layers panel and display on Map view.\n\n![](img09/image5.jpg)\n\n### Saving the centroid layer\n\n> DIY: Using the steps you had learned in previous hands-on exercise, save the temporary `Centroids` layer into GepPackage format. Name the newly created layer `hex_centroid`.\n\nBefore you move on to the next section, remember to remove the temporary `Centroids` layer.\n\n## Network Accessibility Analysis with NEAT3 Plugin\n\nIn this section, you will learn how to perform network accessibility analysis by using QGIS Network Analysis Toolbox (QNEAT3) plugin.\n\n### Installing QNEAT3 plugin.\n\nBefore getting started, you need to install QNEAT3 plugin.\n\n-   From the menu bar, select **Plugins** -\\> **Manage and Install plugins**.\n\nPlugins dialog window appears.\n\n-   At the query, type **QNEAT3**.\n\nNotice that QNEAT3 appears on the search output list.\n\n-   Click on **QNEAT3**.\n\n-   Click on **Install Plugin** button.\n\nWhen the installation is completed, close the dialog box by\n\n-   click on **Close** button.\n\n### Working with OD Matrix tool\n\nNext, we will use the Origin-Destination Matrix (OD Matrix) tool of QNEAT3 plugin to calculate the distances between hexagon centrois (as the demand points) and eldercare centres (as the supply points).\n\n-   From the menu bar, click on **Processing** -\\> **Toolbox**\n\n-   At the **Search** pane, type `OD Matrix`.\n\nYou screen should look similar to the screenshot below.\n\n![](img09/image26.jpg){width=\"45%\"}\n\n-   Click on **OD Matrix Layers as Table (m:n)**.\n\n**OD Matrix Layers as Table (m:n)** dialog window appears.\n\n-   For **Network Layer**, select `roads` from the drop-down list.\n\n-   For **From-Point Layer**, select `hex_centroid` from the drop-down list.\n\n-   For **Unique Point ID Field**, select `fid` from the drop-down list.\n\n-   For **To-Point Layer**, select `eldercare` fro mthe drop-down list.\n\n-   For **Unique Point ID Field**, select `fid` from the drop-down list.\n\n-   For **Optimization Criterion**, select `Shortest Path (distance optimization)` from the drop-down list.\n\n-   For **Entry Cost calculation method**, select `Ellipsoidal` from the drop-down list.\n\n-   For **Direction field**, select `oneway` from the drop-down list.\n\n-   For **Value for forward direction**, type `F`.\n\n-   For **Value for backward direction**, type `T`.\n\n-   For **Value for both direction**, type `B`.\n\n-   For Topology tolerance, type *0.5* (i.e. 0.5 m).\n\nThe completed dialog widnow should look similar to the screenshot below.\n\n![](img09/image27.jpg)\n\nWhen you are ready to run the process.\n\n-   At the **OD Matrix** dialog window, click on **Run** button.\n\nBe patient, the process is computationally intensive.\n\n**Reminder:** Read the log before closing it.\n\nWhen you are ready to close the dialog window.\n\n-   Click on **Close** button.\n\nNotice that a new temporary table called `Output OD Matrix` is added onto Layers panel.\n\n![](img09/image28.jpg){width=\"35%\"}\n\n-   At the Layers panel, right-click on `Output OD Matrix` and select **Open Attribute Table** from the context menu.\n\nA data table look similar to the screenshot below appears.\n\n![](img09/image29.jpg)\n\n> Question: Do you know what are the values of these fields?\n\n> DIY: Using the steps you had learned, save the temporary Output OD Matrix table as GeoPackage format. Name the layer `OD_eldercare`.\n\n### Extracting shortest distance pairs\n\nNext, we will use the SQL tool of QGIS to select destination points with the shortest distance.\n\n-   At the **Search** pane of **Processing Toolbox**, type `SQL`.\n\n**SQL** function appears on the list.\n\n![](img09/image30.jpg){width=\"45%\"}\n\n-   Double-click on **Execute SQL** of **Vector general**.\n\n**Execute SQL** dialog window appears.\n\n-   For **Additional input datasources**, select on the button at the right end.\n\n-   Click on the checkbox **Output OD Matrix**.\n\n![](img09/image31.jpg){width=\"65%\"}\n\n-   Click on **OK** button.\n\n-   At SQL query panel, type the following SQL\n\n![](img09/image32.jpg){width=\"55%\"}\n\n-   For *Geometry type*, select `No Geometry` from the drop-down list.\n\n![](img09/image33.jpg){width=\"45%\"}\n\nNotice that a temporary table called `SQL Output` is added onto **Layers** panel. It consists of four fields. The values in `shortest_distance` field are shortest distance between demand points and its nearest eldercare centre.\n\n![](img09/image34.jpg){width=\"65%\"}\n\n> DIY: Using the steps you had learned, save the temporary `SQL Output` table as GeoPackage format. Name the layer `acc_eldercare`.\n\n### Mapping Accessibility Values\n\nIn this section, we are going to use mapping function of QGIS to show the distribution of accessibility to eldercare\n\n#### Creating a duplicate layer\n\nBefore we getting started, let us create a duplicate copy of `hexagon` layer\n\n-   At the Layers panel, right-click on `hexagon` layer and select **Duplicate Layer** from the context menu.\n\nA new layer called `hexagon` copy is added onto Layers panel.\n\n-   Rename the layer to `Accesibility to eldercare`.\n\n#### Performing relational join.\n\nBefore we can prepare the choropleth map, we need to join `acc_eldercare` data table to the newly created `Accesibility to eldercare` by using *fid* of `acc_eldercare` data table and *fid* of `Accessibility to eldercare` attribute table as unique join fields.\n\n-   At the Layer panel, right-click on `Accesibility to eldercare` layer and select **Properties** from the context menu.\n\nThe Properties dialog window appears.\n\n-   At the option panel, click on **Joins**.\n\n-   Click on **+** button to add a join.\n\nThe **Add Vector Join** dialog window appears.\n\n-   For **Join layer**, select `acc_eldercare` from th drop-down list.\n\n-   For **Join field**, select `fid` from the drop-down list.\n\n-   For **Target field**, select `fid` from the drop-down lsit.\n\n-   Keep the checkbox in front of **Cache join layer in memory** checked.\n\n![](img09/image36.jpg){width=\"45%\"}\n\n-   When you are ready, click on **OK** button.\n\n#### Preparing choropleth map\n\n> DIY: Using the steps you had learned, prepare a choropleth map showing the distribution of accessibility to eldercare centres.\n\nYour choropleth map should look similar to the screenshot below.\n\n![](img09/image35.jpg)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n",
