Publishing GIS maps over the internet is a great way to share our GIS discovery to a wider community. However, building a geoweb mapping application required basic web programming skills such as html, JavaScript and CSS which is beyond the capability of most GIS analysts. In this hands-on exercise, you will learn how to use the **QGIS2Web** plugin of QGIS to build a geoweb map application from your QGIS project.

By the end of this hands-on exercise, you will be able to:


```{r}
#| echo: false
#| eval: false
renderthis::to_pdf(from = "C://tskam/GIS4UrbPlan/_book/Hands-on_Ex12.html",
                   to = "C://SMT201_AY2024-25T2/GIS4UrbPlan/Hands-on_Ex12.pdf")
```
