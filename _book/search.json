It provides the full metadata of Building layer, it symbolization configuration and the data fields.\n\nBy default, QGIS will display the general information of the selected layer. You can retrieve other information or configurations of the layer by clicking on the appropriate tab.\nThe key information available are as follows:\n\nSource shows the path of Building layer.\nStorage reveals the file type, i.e. ESRI Shapefile format.\nGeometry indicate the spatial object used to represent the real world feature.\n\nCRS shows the georeferencing information of the active layer (i.e. SVY21/Singapore TM).\nUnit is the unit measurement of the active layer.\n\nLet us examine other tab.\n• Click on Rendering tab.\nYou screen should look similar to the figure below.\n\nNote that and the minimum map scale is 5000. That explains why the building layer only appears when the map scale of Map View is less than or equal to 1:5000.\nNext, you will explore the data fields of Building layer.\n\nClick on the Field tab.\n\nYour screen should look similar to the figure below.\n\nNotice that there are 12 fields in the corresponding attribute table of Building layer. The Layer Properties window also shows the data type, length and precision of each field.\nYou will explore the other tabs in the next hands-on.\n\nAt the Layer Properties window, click on the cross button located at the upper right hand corner to close the window.\n\n\n\n2.4.2 Working with Identify Features tool\nUsing Identify Features tool to interact with a geographical feature and retrieve its corresponding attribute information is a two steps process. First, you need to make the layer of the feature active. Then, you will use the Identify Features tool to query the information.\nIn this section, you will learn how to query information of a selected Shopping feature (marks by a circle in the figure above).\n• At the Map Legend window, click on Shopping layer to make it active.\n• Click on the Identify Features tool.\n• At the Map View window, hovers the mouse over the shopping feature you are interested to query (the one marked in the figure above).\n• Click on an shopping feature.\nYour screen should look similar to the figure below.\n\nNotice that the selected shopping feature was highlighted (i.e. in red) and the Identify Results window appears.\n\nDIY: Using the steps you had learned from this section, query a building feature, a road network feature and a URA planning area feature.\n\n\n\n2.4.3 Query Attribute Table\nThe ability to interactively select a geographic feature and query its associated attribute information is a very powerful feature of a GIS. However, there are times that you would like to see the attributes of all the features in a GIS layer. In this section, you will learn how to use QGIS’s Open Attribute Table function to display the attribute table of a GIS layer.\n• At the Map Legend window, right-click on Building layer.\n• Select Open Attribute Table from the context menu.\nThe Attribute table window appears.\n\nThe table provide detail information of each geographical feature (i.e. building) such as building name, postal code, road name, block number, just to name a few of them.\n\nDIY: Using the steps you had learned from this section, review the attribute table of Shopping and URA MP2014 Planning Area layers."

Assuming that the root directory of this project is called Hands-on_Ex02,\n\ncreated a sub-folder call data.gov.\n\ninside data.gov, create two new sub-folders. Call them geospatial and aspatial respectively.\nplace the downloaded Master Plan 2014 Subzone Boundary (No Sea), Child Care Services and Street and Places into the geospatial folder.\n\nunzipped their respective zipped files,\nextract the unzipped files, and\nplace them in geospatial folder.\n\nplace the downloaded School Directory and Information zipped file into aspatial sub-folder.\n\nunzipped the file,\ncopy and paste general-information-of-schools.csv into aspatial sub-folder.\n\n\nThe geospatial folder should look similar to the screenshot below.\n\nNotice that besides the geospatial data files, I also include the metadata of the data into the folder. This is because the metadata provide useful information of the data and it is important for us to keep them for future references.\n\n\n3.2.3 Examining the geospatial data\nBefore you add the GIS data into QGIS, you should spend some time to examine the files in geospatial folder.\nNotice that the shapefile version of MP14_SUBZONE_NO_SEA_PL and StreetsandPlaces data sets are actually made up of multiples files that have the same names but with different extensions.\nTable below details the meaning of each file.  Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapefile\nNext, you should also check the projection of the shapefile.\n\nRight-click on the PRJ file of MP14_SUBZONE_NO_SEA_PL\nSelect Open with -> NotePad.\n\nYour NotePad should look similar to the figure below.\n\nFrom the screenshot, it is clear that MP14_SUBZONE_NO_SEA_PL is in svy21 projected coordinate system.\n\nClose the NotePad.\n\nDifferent from shapefile, the geojson and kml files are editing in xml format. You can examine the content of these two files by using either Notepad or WordPad.\n\n\n3.2.4 Adding geospatial data from data.gov into QGIS\nNow, we are ready to bring the geospatial data downloaded from data.giv.sg into QGIS.\n\nFrom Window Desktop, launch QGIS.\n\nYou will start a new QGIS project.\n\nFrom the menu bar, select Project -> New.\n\nNext, you are going to learn how to bring geospatial data sets into QGIS via the Browser panel.\n\nFrom the Browser panel, navigate to the path of Hands-on_Ex02.govas shown in the screenshot below.\n\n\n\nDouble-click on child-care-services-geojson.geojson.\n\nNotice that child-care-services-geojson.geojson is added in the Layer panel and display on the View window as shown below.\n\n\nDIY: Using the steps you had learned, bring in MP14_SUBZONE_NO_SEA_PL.shp and StreetsandPlaces.shp into QGIS.\n\nYour screen should look similar to the figure below.\n\nNotice that child-care-services-geojson layers does not appear on Map View. This is because it is covered by MP14_SUBZONE_NO_SEA_PL layer.\n\nFrom the Layer panel, click on MP14_SUBZONE_NO_SEA_PL layer.\nHold down the left mouse button, drag and place it below child-care-services-geojson.\n\nNow you should see all the active layers appear on the View window as shown below.\n\n\nQGIS Tip: In order to avoid point and line feature layers being blocked away by polygon feature layer, it is always advisible to place the polygon feature layer at the botton of the layer order.\n\nIt is time to save the project.\n\nFrom the menu bar, click Project -> Save (Alternatively, from the icon bar, click on Save Project icon).\nAt the Choose a QGIS project file dialog window, navigate to the root project folder, then provide a proper project name such as Hands-on_Ex02, remember to select QGIS files (.qgs)* from the Save as type: dropdown list.\n\nYour screen should look similar to the figure below.\n\n\nclick on Save button.\n\nNotice that the upper left corner of the top banner is labelled Hands-on_Ex02 instead of untitled now."

    "text": "3.4 Creating Geospatially-Enabled Data\nBy and large, business data such as polyclinics, schools and business establishments do not capture geospatial information such as x- and y- coordinates explicitly. However, it is possible to create geospatially-enabled data from them by using the geocoding technique.\nGeocoding is the process of finding associated geographic coordinates (often expressed as latitude and longitude) from other geographic data, such as street addresses, zip codes or postal codes (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocoding).\n\n3.4.1 Data Preparation\nIn this section, you will learn how to create geospatially enable data by using general-information-of-schools.csv you downloaded from data.gov.sg.\nNote: In this section, we assume that general-information-of-schools.csv is stored in \\Hands-on_Ex02\\data\\data.gov\\aspatial\\ sub-folder and you have Microsoft Excel installed in your computer.\nLet us review the content of general-information-of-schools.csv file.\n\nAt File Explorer, navigate to the sub-folder where general-information-of-schools.csv is stored.\nRight-click on general-information-of-schools.csv file.\nFrom the context menu, select Open with -> Excel.\n\nYour screen should look similar to the figure below.\n\nNotice that general-information-of-schools.csv file consists of 31 fields. However, we only need to retain school_name, address and postal_code field.\n\nUse appropriate Excel function to delete the unwanted fields.\n\nNext, we will create two create two new fields. They are: country and city.\n\nUse appropriate Excel function to create two new fields. Call them country and city.\nFill in the cell below country and city fields with Singapore.\n\nThe final general-information-of-schools.csv should look similar to the screenshot below.\n\n\nUse the Save as function of Excel to save the tidied csv file into Hands-on_Ex02.govsub-folder. Name the output file schools.csv.\n\n\nNote: It is important to ensure that the output file is in csv file format.\n\n\n\n3.4.2 Install the MMQGIS Plugin\nInstead of using the geocoding API of SLA OneMap, in this section you will use the Geocode Tools of MMQGIS plugin developed by Michael Minn.\nTo install the MMQGIS plugin, you will need to load the QGIS plugin repository by following the steps below.\n\nFrom the menu bar, select Plugins –> Manage and Install Plugins.\n\nPlugins dialog window appears as shown below.\n\nNotice that there is a long list of plugins available. We can use the Search function to locate mmqgis plugin easily.\n\nAt Search, type mmqgis.\n\nYour screen should look similar to the figure below.\n\n\nFriendly Advice: It is a good practice to read the documentation of the plugin (i.e. More info: homepage) thoroughly before download or/and using any QGIS plugin.\n\n\nClick on Install Plugin button to run the installer.\n\nAfter installing mmqgis plugin, remember to close the Plugin dialog window.\n\nClick on Close button.\n\n\n\n3.4.3 Geocoding using MMQGIS Plugin\nNow, you are ready geocode schools dataset.\n\nFrom the menu bar, select MMQGIS -> Geocode -> Geocode CSV with Web Service.\n\nWeb Service Geocode dialog window appears.\n\nGeocode Tools of MMQGIS plugin imports addresses from a CSV file. The input CSV file should be encoded in the UTF-8 character set. Although other 8-bit encodings (like Windoze ISO-8859-x) will work if only ASCII characters are present, non-ASCII characters may cause unpredictable behavior.\n\nFrom Input CSV File (UTF-8), click on Browse button.\n\nSelect a file dialog window appears.\n\nNavigate to the path where schools.csv reside.\nClick on schools.csv.\nClick on Open button.\n\nYour screen should similar to the screenshot below.\n\nNotice that the Address, City and Country drop-down lists have been mapped to the corresponding field names in schools.csv. This explains why the data preparation performed in previous step was important and necessary.\nMMQGIS Geocode Tool supports five geocoding services. They are: Google, OpenStreetMap/Nomination, US Census Bureau, ESRI Server and NetToolKit. Except OpenStreetMap/Nomination, the rest of the geocoding services required you to have an API key.\nIn this exercise, OpenStreetmap/Nominatim geocoding service will be used.\n\nWarning: To complete this section, you will need internet access to run the geocoding process.\n\n\nFor Web Service, select OpenStreetMap/Nominatim from the drop-down list.\n\nGeocode Tool will generate two output files.

Like choropleth maps, you can create classed or unclassed versions of these maps. The classed ones are known as range-graded or graduated symbols, and the unclassed are called proportional symbols, where the area of the symbols are proportional to the values of the attribute being mapped.\nIn this section, you will learn how to create a proportional symbol map showing the numbers of win by Singapore Pools’ outlets.\n\nDIY: Before we get started, let us switch off Education, RoadSectionLine and SGOutline layers.\n\nYour screen should look similar to the figure below.\n\nBefore you start to prepare the proportional symbol map, you will take a look at the attribute table of SGPools layer.\n\nAt the Layers panel, right-click on SGPools layer.\nSelect Open Attribute Table from the context menu.\n\nYour screen should look similar to the figure below.\n\nYou are going to use the values in the last filed (e.g Gp1Gp2Winn) to create a proportional symbol map.\n\nClose the table by clicking on the cross icon located at the upper right corner of the table.\n\nNext, you are going to change the size of the point symbol by mapping the values in Gp1Gp2Winn field.\n\nAt the Layers panel, right-click on SGPools layer.\nSelect Properties from the context menu.\n\nThe Layer Properties dialog window appears.\n\nClick on the Symbology icon.\nFor Value, select Gp1Gp2Winngs from the dropdown list.\nFor Method, select Size from the drop-down list.\nFor Size to, type 10.\nClick on Classify button.\n\nYour screen should look similar to the figure below.\n\nWhen you are ready,\n\nClick on Apply button to update the changes.\n\nIn order to view the changes, you need to close the dialog window.\n\nClick on OK to close the Layer Properties dialog window.\n\nYour screen should look similar to the figure below.\n\nNotice that there are many proportional symbols were overlapping.

    "text": "4.6 Choropleth map using GIS\nChoropleth mapping involves the symbolisation of enumeration units, such as countries, provinces, states, counties or census units, using area patterns or graduated colors. For example, a social scientist may need to use a choropleth map to portray the spatial distribution of aged population of Singapore by Master Plan 2014 Subzone Boundary.\nThe major concerns of choropleth mapping are the method of data classification, areal symbolization, and the overall map design. General rules for choropleth mapping are as follows:\n\nUse data that are assumed to be uniform throughout an enumeration unit.\nBecause enumeration units vary in size, do not map totals. Use derived values, such as ratios, rates, proportions, or percentages.\nThe best classing method depends on the data, the map reader and the purpose of the map.\nWhen classifying data, the full range of data must be included and class values should not overlap. No more than six classes are recommended.\nClass symbols (i.e. colors or patterns) must be easily distinguishable.\n\nIn this section of the hands-on exercise, you will learn how to use QGIS to prepare a choropleth map showing the distribution of population with age 65 and above in Singapore by URA’s Master Plan 2014 subzone. You will also gain hands-on experience on the various data classification methods, symbolisation and map layout design techniques offered by QGIS.\n\n4.6.1 Adding geoadministrative layer\n\nDIY: Using the steps you had learned from the previous section, add Master Plan 2014 Subzone Area Boundary (No Sea) layer into QGIS.\n\nYour screen should look similar to the figure below.\n\n\n\n4.6.2 Adding an attribute table in QGIS project\nNow, you will add the POP2020.csv table into the QGIS project. It is stored in \\Hands-on_EX04\\DataTables folder and is in csv format.\n\nFrom the Layers toolbar, click Add Layer -> Add Delimited Text Layer ….\n\nThe Data Source Manager|Delimited Text dialog window appears.\n\n\nAt File Name, click on Browse button at the back.\n\nThe Choose a Delimited Text File to Open dialog window appears.\n• Navigate to -on_Ex04sub folder.\n\n\nClick on POP2020.\n\nClick on the Open button.\n\nYou will return to Data Source Manager|Delimited Text dialog window.\n\nNotice that the dialog window is completed with many information and a preview table.\n\nFor Geometry definition, click on the radio button in front of No geometry (attribute only table).\nClick on Add button.\n\nNotice that a new data layer called POP2020 has been added in the Layers panel.\nWe will close Data Source Manager|Delimited Text dialog window.\n\nClick on OK button.\n\nNext, you will examine the structure of the data.\n• Right-click on POP2020, select Open Attribute Table.\nThe Attribute table dialog window appears.\n\n\n\n4.6.3 Creating relational join\nNow you are ready to perform relational join between the MP14_SubZone GIS layer and the POP2020 attribute layer.\nIn order to join the attribute table of a geospatial data and an aspatial attribute table, we need to identify the common key or popularly known as unique identifier between these two data sets.\n\nDIY: Using the steps you had learned, open the attribute table of MP14_SubZone and POP2020.\n\n\nWith reference to the tables above, the SZ field of POP2020 and SUBZONE_N field of MP14_SUBZONE can be used as the unique identifier filed. However, if you examine the data carefully, there is a problem we should take note of. That is strings in SUBZONE_N are all uppercase. On the other hand, strings in SZ field are made up of upper- and lowercases.\nIn view of this problem, we will create a new field to change strings in SZ into uppercase. We will call the output field SUBZONE.\n\nAt the POP2020 Feature Table, click on Open field calculator icon \n\nThe Field Calculator dialog window appears.\n\nFor Output field name, type SUBZONE.\nFor Output file type, select Text(string) from the drop-down list.\nAt the Expression panel, type as shown below.\n\n\n\nBest practice: This is always a good practice to check the preview to ensure that the result is inline to what you want.\n\n\nClick on OK button when you are ready.\n\nNotice that a new field called SUBZONE has been added into POP2020 data table the strings are all in uppercase.\n\nYou are ready to join both tables now.\n\nFrom the Layers panel, double-click on MP14_SubZone vector layer.\n\nThe Layer Properties dialog window appears.\n• From the Tab menu, click on the Joins tab.\nYour screen should look similar to the figure below.\n\n\nClick on Add new join icon \n\nThe Add Vector Join dialog window appears.\n\nFor Join Layer, select POP2020 from the drop-down list.\nFor Join field, select SUBZONE from the drop-down list.\nFor Target field, select SUBZONE_N from the drop-down list.\n\n\n\nClick on OK button to perform the relational join.\n\nYou will return to the Layer Properties dialog window.\nNotice that a relational joined between POP2020 attribute table and the attribute table of MP14_SubZone has been created.\n\nAt the Layer Properties dialog window, click on the OK button.\n\nStrange, it seems that nothing had happen!\n• At the Layers panel, right click on MP14_SubZone layer and select Open Attribute Table from the context menu.\nYou will notice that the table now contains additional fields from POP2020 attribute layer.\n\nRemember that this joint is temporary. It is not part of the attribute table of MP14_SubZone layer, but is just linked dynamically to the POP2020 attribute layer. If you want to permanently join the attributes, you must save it as a new layer.\n\n\n4.6.4 Creating a choropleth map\nIn this section, you will learn how to create a choropleth map showing the distribution of population age 65 and above by URA’s Master Plan 2014 subzone area.\nFirst, you will create a new field called Age65+ and compute its value by using the calculator function of QGIS.\n\nFrom Layers Panel, right-click on MP14_SubZone, select Open Attribute Table from the context menu.\n\nThe MP14_SubZone attribute table appears.\n\nClick on Open Field Calculator icon .\n\nThe Field calculator dialog window appears.\n\nKeep Create a new field box check.\nFor Output filed name, type Age65+.\nFor Output field type, select Whole number (integer) from the drop-down list.\nAt the Expression panel, build a formula as shown below.\n\n\n\nGentle reminder: Check the preview to ensure that the result is what you want.\n\nTo perform the computation,\n\nClick on the OK button.\n\nNotice that a new field called Age65+ has been added into the attribute table of MP14_SubZone table.\n\nBefore you end this session, you need to save the results into the attribute table permanently.\n\nFrom the icon bar, click on the Toggle editing mode icon .\n\nThe Stop Editing dialog appears.\n\n\nClick on Save button.\nClose the attribute table of MP14_SubZone layer.\n\nYou are ready to prepare the choropleth now.\n\nFrom the Layers panel, double-click on MP14_SubZone layer.\n\nThe Layer Properties dialog window appears.\n\nClick on Symbology tab.\nAt Symbol selection drop-down list, select Graduated from the drop-down list.\nFor Value, select Age65+ from the drop-down list.\nFor Classes, keep it as 5.\nFor Color ramp, choose Blues or any colour of your choice from the drop-down list.\nFor Mode, choose Natural Breaks (Jenks) from the drop-down list. • Click on Classify button.\n\nYour screen should look similar to the figure below.\n\nYou can review the statistical distribution of the classification in histogram.\n\nClick on the Histogram tab.\nClick on Load values button.\n\nYour screen should look similar to the figure below.\n\nThis feature is very useful for casual data analyst because the histogram helps us to understand the differences of each classification method.\n\nClick back Classes tab.\nClick on Apply button.\nClick on the OK button.\n\nYour screen should look similar to the figure below.\n\n\nChallenge: Study the distribution revealed by the choropleth map. Can you identify planning subzones with high concentration of population with age 65 and above? Do these subzone tend to clusters together or randomly distributed?\n\n\nDIY: Using the steps you had learned from the previous sections, create a choropleth maps of percentage of population age 65 and above.\n\n\nChallenge: Compare the two choropleth maps prepared, what conclusion can you draw from the maps?"

    "text": "6.1 What is Trade Area Analysis\nA trade area is the geographic area from which a business draws its customers. The size of a trade area depends on the variety of goods and services offered in the community and its proximity to competing retail markets. In most cases, consumers are willing to travel further to purchase high order goods, such as automobiles, furniture, recreational vehicles, and specialty items than they are to purchase lower order goods, such as clothing, drugs, groceries and gasoline.\nTrade area analysis is a methodology, process or technique that provides a basis for understanding, visualizing and quantifying the extent and characteristics of known or approximated trade areas. It has been used by businesses to gain better understanding on the geographic extent and characteristics of business patronage, to assess business performance spatially, to perform competitive analysis, to evaluate market penetration and to identify market gap. Prior to GIS age, trade area analysis was a very time-consuming process. A simple trade area study for a retail operation can easily take more than six months or a year to complete. Today, with appropriate and readily available GIS data and open source GIS such as QGIS, it is possible to complete a trade area analysis within a week.\nIn this exercise, you will learn how to use the GIS analysis functions such as buffering, overlaying, voronoi diagram to delineate trade areas of a retail business. You will also learn how to use appropriate GIS analyse and mapping techniques to analyse and visualize the potential customers of these trade areas.\n\n6.1.1 Setting the Scene\nXBS is a well established local bank. It has a total of 30 branches scatter around the country. The bank is planning to launch a special low interest loan programme to help small- and medium-scale enterprises (SME) to improve the productivity of their workers. Before the scheme is launched, Richard Lim, the Senior Vice President of XBS Retail Banking would like to find out the numbers of SMEs located within the trade areas of XBS branches.\n\n\n6.1.2 Framing the Problem and Collecting the Data\nThree GIS data are available for this study. They are:\n\nLocations of Banking facilities and their associated information (i.e. Banking)\nLocation SME and their associated information (i.e. SME)\nOutline map of Singapore (i.e. CoastalOutline)\n\nThese dataset can be found in the Hands-on_Ex06.zip. You are required to download them and save into your local drive. Throughout this hands-on exercise, we will assume that these GIS data and other derived GIS data are stored in the \\SMT201\\Hands-on_Ex06 sub-folder of your local drive."

    "text": "6.3 Trade Area Delineation\n\n6.3.1 Delineating Ring Trade Areas using Buffering Tool\nThe buffer zone method is one of the quickest and simplest procedures for delineating a catchment area, representing the area by means of one or more concentric circles with the location at their centre (core, close and outer area, see Fig. 1).\n\nIn this method, each zone is determined by the radius of the buffer zone measured ‘as the crow flies’. Traditionally, delineating trade areas for a collection retail outlets such as bank branches can be rather time-consuming. With GIS, trade areas can be delineated using the buffering tool of QGIS.\nIn this section, you are going to create a 1km buffer around the XBS bank branches.\n\nFrom the menu bar, select Vector -> Geoprocessing Tools -> Buffer.. .\n\nThe Buffer dialog window appears.\n\nFor Input layer, select XBS_branches from the drop-down list.\nFor Distance, type 1000. (Do you know why?)\nFor Segments, type 100. (Do you know why?)\n\nKeep the rest of setting as default.\nYour screen should look similar to the screenshot below.\n\nNext, you will run the buffering process.\n\nClick on Run button.\n\nWhen the geoprocessing process completed, the Buffer dialog window will be updated with the geoprocessing log as shown in the screenshot below.\n\n\nGood Practice: Always read the output log carefully before moving to the next step.\n\nSince the buffering process is completed without any error, you can close the Buffer dialog window now.\n• From Buffer dialog window, click on Close button.\nNotice that a new GIS layer called Buffered has been added into the Browser panel.\nBy default, the output is stored in the memory as shown in the screenshot below.\n\nIn order to avoid losing the analysis result, it is wiser for us to save buffering output in local drive.\n\nDIY: Using the steps you had learned in previous hands-on exercise, save the output buffering layer into GeoPackage format. Name the newly create layer Overlapping_buffer_1km. Also, don’t forget to remove the temporary output layer!\n\nYour screen should look similar to the screenshot below.\n\nA close examination of the screenshot above, we will notice that there are several overlapping buffers especially at the down-town area.\nNext, you will delineate dissolved buffers to overcome the overlapping buffers problem.\n\nDIY: Repeat the steps above to delineate a new set of trade areas using the buffering tool. Use the configurations similar to the steps above except check the Dissolve results. Name the output GeoPackage layer as Dissolved_buffer_1km. Also, don’t forget to remove the temporary output layer!\n\nYour result should look similar to the screenshot below.\n\n\n\n6.3.2 Delineating Trade Areas using Voronoi Tool\nVoronoi polygons, also known as Thiessen polygons, represent areas of influence around a set of focal points (or retail outlets as in this study). They can be generated based on a set of points as centroid for the polygons. Voronoi polygons have been so constructed that each polygon contains exactly one of the outlets and that any location with a Voronoi polygon is closer to that point outlet (centroid) than to any other point outlets.\nThis polygon structure is constructed by using the perpendicular bisectors between neighbouring points (in this case, retail outlets) as the boundaries of the resulting Voronoi polygons.\n\n\nFrom the menu bar, select Vector -> Geometric Tools -> Voronoi Polygon.\n\nVoronoi Polygons dialog window appears.\n\nFor Input layer, select XBS_branches from the drop-down list.\nFor Buffer region, type 100. (Do you know why?)\n\nYour screen should look similar to the screenshot below.\n\nNext, you will run the geoprocess.\n\nAt Voronoi Polygons dialog window, click on Run button.\n\nWhen the voronoi polygon computation process completed, you screen should look similar to the screenshot below.\n\nYou can close Voronoi Polygons dialog window now.\n\nFrom Voronoi Polygons dialog window, click on Close button.\n\n\nDIY: Using the steps you had learned from previous section, save the output as GeoPackage layer. Name the output file Voronoi_TAs. Remember to remove the temporary layer from Browser pane.\n\nYour screen should look similar to the screenshot below."

For example, a crime analyst may need to use a choropleth map to portray the spatial patterns of household income distribution of Singapore by DGP (Development Guide Plan) Subzone.\nThe major concerns of choropleth mapping are the method of data classification, areal symbolization, and the overall map design. General rules for choropleth mapping are as follows:\n\nUse data that are assumed to be uniform throughout an enumeration unit.\nBecause enumeration units vary in size, do not map totals. Use derived values, such as ratios, rates, proportions, or percentages.\nThe best classing method depends on the data, the map reader and the purpose of the map.\nWhen classifying data, the full range of data must be included and class values should not overlap. No more than six classes are recommended.\nClass symbols (i.e. colors or patterns) must be easily distinguishable.\n\n\nDIY: Use the steps you had learned from previous lesson, prepare a choropleth map showing the number of SMEs fall within the trade areas of XBS branches.\n\nYour screen should look similar to the screenshot below."

    "section": "8.6 Binary Model",
    "text": "8.6 Binary Model\nA binary land suitability model is the simplest GIS modelling approach analogous to the manual procedures for map analysis popularized in the classic landscape planning book entitled Design with Nature by Ian L, Mcharg (1969).\n\n8.6.1 Deriving binary layers\nBefore we generate the land suitability map, we will first derive a preference layer for each factor layer under consideration. These preference layers will be encoded in binary form whereby 1 denotes suitable and 0 denotes not suitable.\nFor this land suitability analysis, the followings have been suggested:\n\nEconomic factor: < =15deg slope\nAccessibility factor: <= 200m from roads.\nHealth risk factor: >= 250m away from population i.e. housing areas and offices.\n\n\n\n8.6.2 Deriving slop preference layer\nTo derive the preference layer for slope, the Reclassify operation of QGIS will be used. In QGIS there are two sets of Reclassify operators. One set is provided natively by QGIS under the Raster analysis family in Processing Toolbox. The second set of Reclassify operators is from SAGA (http://www.saga-gis.org/en/index.html). For the purpose of our analysis, the Reclassify by table function of QGIS will be used.\n\nFrom the menu bar, click on Processing -> Toolbox.\n\nBy default, Processing Toolbox will appear on the right-hand side of the QGIS project window as shown in the screenshot below.\n\nThere are more than 600 hundred functions provided by QGIS processing toolbox. The easier way to look for a function is by using the search function. For example, by type the word reclassify in the search, Processing Toolbox lists the reclassify functions available as shown in the screenshot below.\n\n\nDouble click on Reclassify by Table function.\n\nThe Reclassify by Table dialog window appears.\n\nFor Raster layer, select the target raster layer you want to process i.e. Slope from the drop-down list.\nClick on the button at the end of Reclassification table.\n\nThe Fixed table dialog window appears.\n\n\nClick on the Add Row button.\n\nYour screen should look similar to the screenshot below.\n\n\nType in the values as shown in the screenshoot below.\n\n\nBasically, the value ranges above recode all cell values into either 0 or 1 by using 15 as the cut-off value.\n\nClick on OK button to close the dialog window.\nFrom the Range boundaries, select min < value <= max from the drop-down list.\n\n\n\nCaution: Select the appropriate range defination in order the ensure the output values are mutually exclusive and truly reflect the cut-off value(s).\n\n\nFor Output data type, select Float32 from the drop-down list.\n\nWhen you are ready,\n\nClick on Run button.\n\nWhen to process completed, the processing log appears.\n\nIt is a best practice to read the report carefully, special attention should be given to the section of Using classes.\n\nClick on Close button to close the dialog window.\n\nA temporary layer called Reclassified raster will be added in QGIS project as shown in the screenshot below.\n\nAccording to the legend, the black grids indicate locations with slope value greater than 15 degrees and white grids indicate locations with slope value less than or equal to 15 degrees.\n\nDIY: Using the steps you had learned in previous section, save the temporary output layer into GeoPackage format. Call the data layer as binary_slope.\n\n\nDIY: Repeat the steps above to derive the preference layers for accessibility and health risk factors. Save the temporary output layers into GeoPackage format and name the data layers as binary_roads and binary_buildings respectively.\n\nThe binary_road should look similar to the screenshot below.\n\nThe binary_road should look similar to the screenshot below.\n\n\n\n8.6.3 Computing composite binary suitability layer\nNow, it is time for us to put the Humpty Dumpty together. The task will be accomplished performed by map algebra operation of GIS. Map algebra is a set-based algebra for manipulating geographic data, proposed by Dr. Dana Tomlin in the early 1980s. It is a set of primitive operations in a geographic information system (GIS) which allows two or more raster layers (“maps”) of similar dimensions to produce a new raster layer (map) using algebraic operations such as addition, multiplication etc (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map_algebra). In this section, you will perform map algebra computation by using Raster Calculator function of QGIS.\n\nAt the Search pane of Geoprocessing Toolbox panel, type raster calculator.\n\nYour screen should look similar to the screenshot below.\n\nThe search result shows that there are three raster calculator functions are available in QGIS. For this task, the Raster calculator of Raster analysis will be used.\n\nDouble-click on Raster calculator of Raster analysis.\n\nThe dialog window of Raster Calculator appears.\n\nAt the Layers panel of Raster Calculator dialog window, double-click on binary_buildings layer.\n\nNotice that the Expression pane of Raster Calculator dialog window will be updated as shown below.\n\n\nNext, click on the multiplication icon.\nNext, double-click on binary_roads layer.\nNext, click on the multiplication icon.\nNext, double-click on binary_slope layer.\n\nThe final expression should look similar to the screenshot below.\n\n\nMy two cents worth: As a beginner, it is advisible not to type the syntax by hand in order to avoid unnecessary typo error.\n\nNext, you need define the output layer format. Raster Calculator provides two ways to define the output layer format.\nFirstly by using the Reference layers(s) interface.\n\nClick on the icon located at the end of the interface.\n\nThe Multiple selection dialog window appears.\n\nClick on the check-box in front of the raster layer(s) you want to use as the reference layer(s) i.e. binary_buildings.\n\n\n\nClick on OK button to close the dialog window.\n\nAlternatively, you can provide the output layer specification using the individual interfaces as shown in the screenshot below.\n\n\nFor Output, keep the default.\nFinally, click on Run button to run the operation.\n\nWhen the processing completed, refer to the process log to ensure that there is no error.\n\n\nClick on Close button to close the Raster Calculator dialog window.\n\nNotice that a temporary raster layer called Output is added in QGIS project.\n\nWith reference to the Output raster layer, the white grids indicate location suitable for the proposed land development. The black grids, on the other hand, indicate location not suitable for the proposed land developmnet.\n\nDIY: Using the steps you had learned in previous section, save Output layer in GeoPackage format. Call the data layer binary_model. Then, remove the temporary Output raster layer from QGIS project."

    "section": "9.1 Ranking Model",
    "text": "9.1 Ranking Model\nThe ranking modelling is the second most popular method used in GIS-based land suitability analysis. This method comprises of two major steps, they are:\n\nDeriving preference data layers by scoring the input data layers with ordinal scales of choices i.e. 3-scale (3-suitable, 2-average, 1-not suitable), 5-scale (5-very suitable, 4-suitable, 3-average, 2-not suitable, 1-very not suitable)\nCombining preference data layers by using map algebra operations.\n\n\n9.1.1 Deriving ranked scores\nIn this section, you will learn how to derive the preference layers from the three factor layers by using the following criteria:\n\nEconomic factor: <=5o slope = 5, 5o-10o = 4, 10o-20o = 3, 20o-30o = 2, >30o = 1.\nAccessibility factor: <=100m = 5, 100-200m = 4, 200-300m = 3, 300-500m = 2, >500m = 1 from roads.\nHealth risk factor: <=100m = 1, 100-200m = 2, 200-300m = 3, 300-500m = 4, >500m = 5 away from population i.e. housing areas and offices.\n\n\n\n9.1.2 Deriving economic factor preference layer\nIn order to derive the economic factor preference layer from the slope layer, the reclassifying operation of raster GIS will be used. In QGIS, raster reclassifying can be performed by using Reclassify by Table function.\n\nFrom Processing Toolbox, search for Reclassify by Table, double-click on it.\n\n\nThe dialog window of Reclassify by Table appears.\n\nFor Raster Layer, select slope from the drop-down list.\nFor Reclassification table, click on the icon.\n\nThe dialog window of Fixed table appears.\n\nEnter the value similar to the screenshot below.\n\n\nReminder: Click on Add Row button when you want to add a new row.\n\nClick on OK button when you have completed the entry.\n\nYou will back to the dialog window of Reclassify by Table.\n\nFor Range boundaries, select the option similar to the screenshot below.\n\n\n\nFor Output data type, select Float32 from the drop-down list.\nLastly, click on Run button to run the process.\n\nNote: Pay attention to the Using classes section of the report log. This is the actual reclassification scheme defined using Fixed table and Range boundaries functions of Reclassify by Table of QGIS.\n\n\nWhen you are done with reviewing the report log, click on Close button to close the dialog window of Reclassify by Table.\n\nNotice that a new temporary raster layer will be added on the view window of QGIS as shown in the screenshot below.\n\n\nDIY: Using the steps you had learned in the earlier section, save the temporary raster layer into Geopackage format. Name the data layer as rank_ecofac. Then, remove the temporary raster layer from QGIS.\n\n\nDIY: Using the steps you had learned in earlier sections, derive the rank scores layers for accessibility and health risk factors respectively. Save the temporary raster layer into Geopackage format. Name the data layers as rank_accfac and rank_heafac. Then, remove the temporary raster layers from QGIS.\n\nScreenshot below shows the rank-scores layer of economic factor (i.e. rank_ecofac).\n\nWith reference to the legend, the darkest orange grids are locations rank the best in terms of economic factor because, by-and-large, they are the locations relatively flat (i.e. <=5o). The lightest orange grids, on-the-other hand, are location rank the least preferred locations in terms of economic factor because they are locations with relatively steep slopes (i.e. >30o).\nScreenshot below shows the rank-scores layer of health risk factor.\nWith reference to the legend, the darkest orange grids are locations rank the best in terms of health risk factor because they are the furthest away from existing buildings. The lightest orange grids, on-the-other hand, are location rank the least preferred locations in terms of health risk because they are closest to the existing buildings.\n\nScreenshot below shows the rank-scores layer of accessibility factor.\n\nWith reference to the legend, the darkest orange grids are locations rank the best in terms of accessibility because they are the nearest from existing roads. The lightest orange grids, on-the-other hand, are location rank the least preferred locations in terms of accessibility consideration because they are furthest away from existing roads.\n\n\n9.1.3 Computing composite rank scores suitability layer\nNow, it is time for us to put the Humpty Dumpty together. The task will be performed by using Raster Calculator of QGIS. However, different from computing composite binary suitability layer, this time the additive operation will be used.\n\nDIY: Using the steps you had learned from previous hands-on exercise, launch Raster Calculator from Raster Analysis.\n\nThe dialog window of Raster calculator appears.\n\nDIY: Using the steps you had learned in previous hands-on exercise, build a map algebra equation similar to the screenshot below.\n\n\n\nDIY: Using the steps you had learned in previous hands-on exercise, complete the Reference layer(s) inputs.\n\n\nWhen you are ready to run the process, click on Run button.\n\n\nSuggestion: When the processing completed, refer to the process log to ensure that there is no computational error.\n\nWhen you have read the processing log,\n\nClick on Close button to close the dialog window of Raster calculator.\n\nNotice that a new temporary layer called Output has been added on the map view window of QGIS as shown in the screenshot below.\nThe legend of Output layer indicates that the minimum composite score value is 7 and the maximum score value is 15.\n\n\nDIY: Using the steps you had learned in previous section, save Output in Geopackage format. Name the newly created data layer as rank_suitability.\n\nAccording to the recommendation of a senior planner, the selected site should have at least a composite scores of 12 (i.e. at least 4 and above for each factor). We will take his advise to prepare the final suitability site layer.\n\nDIY: Using the steps you had learned from previous section, reclass rank_suitability. Save the output into GeoPackage format and name the layer as rank_model.\n\nThe rank_model should look similar to the screenshot below."

    "text": "10.3 Analytical Hexagon\nIn GIS analysis, regularly shaped grids is used for many reasons such as normalizing geography for mapping or to mitigate the issues of using irregularly shaped polygons created arbitrarily (such as county boundaries or block groups that have been created from a political process). Regularly shaped grids can only be comprised of equilateral triangles, squares, or hexagons, as these three polygon shapes are the only three that can tessellate (repeating the same shape over and over again, edge to edge, to cover an area without gaps or overlaps) to create an evenly spaced grid.\n\nThough the square (fishnet) grid is the predominantly used shape type in GIS analysis and thematic mapping, there are ways in which hexagons may be better suited for your analysis based on the nature of your question.\nHexagons reduce sampling bias due to edge effects of the grid shape, this is related to the low perimeter-to-area ratio of the shape of the hexagon.

    "text": "11.1 Ranking Model\nThe ranking modelling is the second most popular method used in GIS-based land suitability analysis. This method comprises of two major steps, they are:\n\nDeriving preference data layers by scoring the input data layers with ordinal scales of choices i.e. 3-scale (3-suitable, 2-average, 1-not suitable), 5-scale (5-very suitable, 4-suitable, 3-average, 2-not suitable, 1-very not suitable)\nCombining preference data layers by using map algebra operations.\n\n\n11.1.1 Deriving ranked scores\nIn this section, you will learn how to derive the preference layers from the three factor layers by using the following criteria:\n\nEconomic factor: <=5o slope = 5, 5o-10o = 4, 10o-20o = 3, 20o-30o = 2, >30o = 1.\nAccessibility factor: <=100m = 5, 100-200m = 4, 200-300m = 3, 300-500m = 2, >500m = 1 from roads.\nHealth risk factor: <=100m = 1, 100-200m = 2, 200-300m = 3, 300-500m = 4, >500m = 5 away from population i.e. housing areas and offices.\n\n\n\n11.1.2 Deriving economic factor preference layer\nIn order to derive the economic factor preference layer from the slope layer, the reclassifying operation of raster GIS will be used. In QGIS, raster reclassifying can be performed by using Reclassify by Table function.\n\nFrom Processing Toolbox, search for Reclassify by Table, double-click on it.\n\n\nThe dialog window of Reclassify by Table appears.\n\nFor Raster Layer, select slope from the drop-down list.\nFor Reclassification table, click on the icon.\n\nThe dialog window of Fixed table appears.\n\nEnter the value similar to the screenshot below.\n\n\nReminder: Click on Add Row button when you want to add a new row.\n\nClick on OK button when you have completed the entry.\n\nYou will back to the dialog window of Reclassify by Table.\n\nFor Range boundaries, select the option similar to the screenshot below.\n\n\n\nFor Output data type, select Float32 from the drop-down list.\nLastly, click on Run button to run the process.\n\nNote: Pay attention to the Using classes section of the report log. This is the actual reclassification scheme defined using Fixed table and Range boundaries functions of Reclassify by Table of QGIS.\n\n\nWhen you are done with reviewing the report log, click on Close button to close the dialog window of Reclassify by Table.\n\nNotice that a new temporary raster layer will be added on the view window of QGIS as shown in the screenshot below.\n\n\nDIY: Using the steps you had learned in the earlier section, save the temporary raster layer into Geopackage format. Name the data layer as rank_ecofac. Then, remove the temporary raster layer from QGIS.\n\n\nDIY: Using the steps you had learned in earlier sections, derive the rank scores layers for accessibility and health risk factors respectively. Save the temporary raster layer into Geopackage format. Name the data layers as rank_accfac and rank_heafac. Then, remove the temporary raster layers from QGIS.\n\nScreenshot below shows the rank-scores layer of economic factor (i.e. rank_ecofac).\n\nWith reference to the legend, the darkest orange grids are locations rank the best in terms of economic factor because, by-and-large, they are the locations relatively flat (i.e. <=5o). The lightest orange grids, on-the-other hand, are location rank the least preferred locations in terms of economic factor because they are locations with relatively steep slopes (i.e. >30o).\nScreenshot below shows the rank-scores layer of health risk factor.\nWith reference to the legend, the darkest orange grids are locations rank the best in terms of health risk factor because they are the furthest away from existing buildings. The lightest orange grids, on-the-other hand, are location rank the least preferred locations in terms of health risk because they are closest to the existing buildings.\n\nScreenshot below shows the rank-scores layer of accessibility factor.\n\nWith reference to the legend, the darkest orange grids are locations rank the best in terms of accessibility because they are the nearest from existing roads. The lightest orange grids, on-the-other hand, are location rank the least preferred locations in terms of accessibility consideration because they are furthest away from existing roads.\n\n\n11.1.3 Computing composite rank scores suitability layer\nNow, it is time for us to put the Humpty Dumpty together. The task will be performed by using Raster Calculator of QGIS. However, different from computing composite binary suitability layer, this time the additive operation will be used.\n\nDIY: Using the steps you had learned from previous hands-on exercise, launch Raster Calculator from Raster Analysis.\n\nThe dialog window of Raster calculator appears.\n\nDIY: Using the steps you had learned in previous hands-on exercise, build a map algebra equation similar to the screenshot below.\n\n\n\nDIY: Using the steps you had learned in previous hands-on exercise, complete the Reference layer(s) inputs.\n\n\nWhen you are ready to run the process, click on Run button.\n\n\nSuggestion: When the processing completed, refer to the process log to ensure that there is no computational error.\n\nWhen you have read the processing log,\n\nClick on Close button to close the dialog window of Raster calculator.\n\nNotice that a new temporary layer called Output has been added on the map view window of QGIS as shown in the screenshot below.\nThe legend of Output layer indicates that the minimum composite score value is 7 and the maximum score value is 15.\n\n\nDIY: Using the steps you had learned in previous section, save Output in Geopackage format. Name the newly created data layer as rank_suitability.\n\nAccording to the recommendation of a senior planner, the selected site should have at least a composite scores of 12 (i.e. at least 4 and above for each factor). We will take his advise to prepare the final suitability site layer.\n\nDIY: Using the steps you had learned from previous section, reclass rank_suitability. Save the output into GeoPackage format and name the layer as rank_model.\n\nThe rank_model should look similar to the screenshot below."

But the function does not provide detail report. In view of this, students are encouraged to use Excel-based AHP library such as the AHP Template provided by SCB Associates.\n\nDIY: Use the link provided above, download the AHP template.

    "text": "12.3 Analytical Hexagon\nIn GIS analysis, regularly shaped grids is used for many reasons such as normalizing geography for mapping or to mitigate the issues of using irregularly shaped polygons created arbitrarily (such as county boundaries or block groups that have been created from a political process). Regularly shaped grids can only be comprised of equilateral triangles, squares, or hexagons, as these three polygon shapes are the only three that can tessellate (repeating the same shape over and over again, edge to edge, to cover an area without gaps or overlaps) to create an evenly spaced grid.\n\nThough the square (fishnet) grid is the predominantly used shape type in GIS analysis and thematic mapping, there are ways in which hexagons may be better suited for your analysis based on the nature of your question.\nHexagons reduce sampling bias due to edge effects of the grid shape, this is related to the low perimeter-to-area ratio of the shape of the hexagon. A circle has the lowest ratio but cannot tessellate to form a continuous grid. Hexagons are the most circular-shaped polygon that can tessellate to form an evenly spaced grid.\n\n\n12.3.1 Creating hexagon layer\nNow, we are going to create a hexagon layer by using mpsz layer as the based. The hexagon distance is 250m.\n\nFrom the menu bar, select Vector -> Research Tools -> Create Grids.\n\nCreate Grids dialog window appears.\n\nFor Grid type: select Hexagon (Polygon) from the drop down list.\n\n\n\nFor Grid extend:, select Calculate from Layer -> mpsz\n\n\n\nFor Horizontal spacing, type 500.\nFor Vertical spacing, type 500.\n\n\nQuestion: Do you know why 500 is used?\n\n\nFor Grid CRS, make sure that EPSG 3414 is used.\n\nWhen you are ready to run the process,\n\nClick on Run button.\n\nReminder: Read the Log before closing the dialog window.\n\nClick on Close button.\n\nNotice that a new temporary layer called Grid is added on the Layer pane and display on Map window.\n\n\n\n12.3.2 Editing the hexagon layer\n\nDIY: Using appropriate QGIS functions, edit the temporary Grid layer until it looks similar to the screenshot below.\n\n\n\n\n12.3.3 Saving the hexagon layer\n\nDIY: Using the steps you had learned in previous hands-on exercise, save the edited Grid layer into GeoPackage format. Give the layer a name (i.e. hexagon)\n\nBefore you move on to the next section, remember to remove the temporary Grid layer.\n\n\n12.3.4 Computing hexagon centroid\nIn general, network analysis required the demand in a point feature. Hexagon, on the other hand, is a polygon feature. In order to meet the analysis need, we will compute the centroids of the hexagons.\n\nFrom the menu bar, select Vector -> Geometry Tools -> Centroids.\n\nCentroids dialog window appears.\n\nFor Input layer, select hexagon from the drop-down list.\n\nWhen you are ready to run the process,\n\nClick on Run button.\n\nReminder: Read the log before closing.\n\nClick on Close button.\n\nNotice that a new temporary layer called Centroid is added onto Layers panel and display on Map view.\n\n\n12.3.4.1 Saving the centroid layer\n\nDIY: Using the steps you had learned in previous hands-on exercise, save the temporary Centroids layer into GepPackage format.

    "section": "13.1 Ranking Model",
    "text": "13.1 Ranking Model\nThe ranking modelling is the second most popular method used in GIS-based land suitability analysis. This method comprises of two major steps, they are:\n\nDeriving preference data layers by scoring the input data layers with ordinal scales of choices i.e. 3-scale (3-suitable, 2-average, 1-not suitable), 5-scale (5-very suitable, 4-suitable, 3-average, 2-not suitable, 1-very not suitable)\nCombining preference data layers by using map algebra operations.\n\n\n13.1.1 Deriving ranked scores\nIn this section, you will learn how to derive the preference layers from the three factor layers by using the following criteria:\n\nEconomic factor: <=5o slope = 5, 5o-10o = 4, 10o-20o = 3, 20o-30o = 2, >30o = 1.\nAccessibility factor: <=100m = 5, 100-200m = 4, 200-300m = 3, 300-500m = 2, >500m = 1 from roads.\nHealth risk factor: <=100m = 1, 100-200m = 2, 200-300m = 3, 300-500m = 4, >500m = 5 away from population i.e. housing areas and offices.\n\n\n\n13.1.2 Deriving economic factor preference layer\nIn order to derive the economic factor preference layer from the slope layer, the reclassifying operation of raster GIS will be used. In QGIS, raster reclassifying can be performed by using Reclassify by Table function.\n\nFrom Processing Toolbox, search for Reclassify by Table, double-click on it.\n\n\nThe dialog window of Reclassify by Table appears.\n\nFor Raster Layer, select slope from the drop-down list.\nFor Reclassification table, click on the icon.\n\nThe dialog window of Fixed table appears.\n\nEnter the value similar to the screenshot below.\n\n\nReminder: Click on Add Row button when you want to add a new row.\n\nClick on OK button when you have completed the entry.\n\nYou will back to the dialog window of Reclassify by Table.\n\nFor Range boundaries, select the option similar to the screenshot below.\n\n\n\nFor Output data type, select Float32 from the drop-down list.\nLastly, click on Run button to run the process.\n\nNote: Pay attention to the Using classes section of the report log. This is the actual reclassification scheme defined using Fixed table and Range boundaries functions of Reclassify by Table of QGIS.\n\n\nWhen you are done with reviewing the report log, click on Close button to close the dialog window of Reclassify by Table.\n\nNotice that a new temporary raster layer will be added on the view window of QGIS as shown in the screenshot below.\n\n\nDIY: Using the steps you had learned in the earlier section, save the temporary raster layer into Geopackage format. Name the data layer as rank_ecofac. Then, remove the temporary raster layer from QGIS.\n\n\nDIY: Using the steps you had learned in earlier sections, derive the rank scores layers for accessibility and health risk factors respectively. Save the temporary raster layer into Geopackage format. Name the data layers as rank_accfac and rank_heafac. Then, remove the temporary raster layers from QGIS.\n\nScreenshot below shows the rank-scores layer of economic factor (i.e. rank_ecofac).\n\nWith reference to the legend, the darkest orange grids are locations rank the best in terms of economic factor because, by-and-large, they are the locations relatively flat (i.e. <=5o). The lightest orange grids, on-the-other hand, are location rank the least preferred locations in terms of economic factor because they are locations with relatively steep slopes (i.e. >30o).\nScreenshot below shows the rank-scores layer of health risk factor.\nWith reference to the legend, the darkest orange grids are locations rank the best in terms of health risk factor because they are the furthest away from existing buildings. The lightest orange grids, on-the-other hand, are location rank the least preferred locations in terms of health risk because they are closest to the existing buildings.\n\nScreenshot below shows the rank-scores layer of accessibility factor.\n\nWith reference to the legend, the darkest orange grids are locations rank the best in terms of accessibility because they are the nearest from existing roads. The lightest orange grids, on-the-other hand, are location rank the least preferred locations in terms of accessibility consideration because they are furthest away from existing roads.\n\n\n13.1.3 Computing composite rank scores suitability layer\nNow, it is time for us to put the Humpty Dumpty together. The task will be performed by using Raster Calculator of QGIS. However, different from computing composite binary suitability layer, this time the additive operation will be used.\n\nDIY: Using the steps you had learned from previous hands-on exercise, launch Raster Calculator from Raster Analysis.\n\nThe dialog window of Raster calculator appears.\n\nDIY: Using the steps you had learned in previous hands-on exercise, build a map algebra equation similar to the screenshot below.\n\n\n\nDIY: Using the steps you had learned in previous hands-on exercise, complete the Reference layer(s) inputs.\n\n\nWhen you are ready to run the process, click on Run button.\n\n\nSuggestion: When the processing completed, refer to the process log to ensure that there is no computational error.\n\nWhen you have read the processing log,\n\nClick on Close button to close the dialog window of Raster calculator.\n\nNotice that a new temporary layer called Output has been added on the map view window of QGIS as shown in the screenshot below.\nThe legend of Output layer indicates that the minimum composite score value is 7 and the maximum score value is 15.\n\n\nDIY: Using the steps you had learned in previous section, save Output in Geopackage format. Name the newly created data layer as rank_suitability.\n\nAccording to the recommendation of a senior planner, the selected site should have at least a composite scores of 12 (i.e. at least 4 and above for each factor). We will take his advise to prepare the final suitability site layer.\n\nDIY: Using the steps you had learned from previous section, reclass rank_suitability. Save the output into GeoPackage format and name the layer as rank_model.\n\nThe rank_model should look similar to the screenshot below."

But the function does not provide detail report. In view of this, students are encouraged to use Excel-based AHP library such as the AHP Template provided by SCB Associates.\n\nDIY: Use the link provided above, download the AHP template. Run the Excel template and perform AHP analysis by following the instruction provided.\n\nYour AHP will look similar to the figure below.\n\nWith the AHP scores as shown below.\n\nFrom the above results, health risk factor poses the most critical factor and economic factor being the least weighted factor in determining the suitable location for CDQC.\nThe consistency check of 3% is below 10% and the inconsistency is acceptable.\n\n\n13.2.3 Computing the Suitability Layer\nNow, you will compute the Land Suitability Layer by using the factor scores derived above.\n\nDIY: Using the steps you had learned from previous sections, compute the land suitability layer by using Raster Calculator of QGIS.
