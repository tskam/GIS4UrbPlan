    "text": "4.5 Creating Proportional Symbol Map\nProportional symbol maps (also known as graduate symbol maps) are a class of maps that use the visual variable of size to represent differences in the magnitude of a discrete, abruptly changing phenomenon, e.g. counts of people. Like choropleth maps, you can create classed or unclassed versions of these maps. The classed ones are known as range-graded or graduated symbols, and the unclassed are called proportional symbols, where the area of the symbols are proportional to the values of the attribute being mapped.\nIn this section, you will learn how to create a proportional symbol map showing the numbers of win by Singapore Pools’ outlets.\n\nDIY: Before we get started, let us switch off Education, RoadSectionLine and SGOutline layers.\n\nYour screen should look similar to the figure below.\n\nBefore you start to prepare the proportional symbol map, you will take a look at the attribute table of SGPools layer.\n\nAt the Layers panel, right-click on SGPools layer.\nSelect Open Attribute Table from the context menu.\n\nYour screen should look similar to the figure below.\n\nYou are going to use the values in the last filed (e.g Gp1Gp2Winn) to create a proportional symbol map.\n\nClose the table by clicking on the cross icon located at the upper right corner of the table.\n\nNext, you are going to change the size of the point symbol by mapping the values in Gp1Gp2Winn field.\n\nAt the Layers panel, right-click on SGPools layer.\nSelect Properties from the context menu.\n\nThe Layer Properties dialog window appears.\n\nClick on the Symbology icon.\nFor Value, select Gp1Gp2Winngs from the dropdown list.\nFor Method, select Size from the drop-down list.\nFor Size to, type 10.\nClick on Classify button.\n\nYour screen should look similar to the figure below.\n\nWhen you are ready,\n\nClick on Apply button to update the changes.\n\nIn order to view the changes, you need to close the dialog window.\n\nClick on OK to close the Layer Properties dialog window.\n\nYour screen should look similar to the figure below.\n\nNotice that there are many proportional symbols were overlapping.

    "section": "4.6 Choropleth map using GIS",
    "text": "4.6 Choropleth map using GIS\nChoropleth mapping involves the symbolisation of enumeration units, such as countries, provinces, states, counties or census units, using area patterns or graduated colors. For example, a social scientist may need to use a choropleth map to portray the spatial distribution of aged population of Singapore by Master Plan 2014 Subzone Boundary.\nThe major concerns of choropleth mapping are the method of data classification, areal symbolization, and the overall map design. General rules for choropleth mapping are as follows:\n\nUse data that are assumed to be uniform throughout an enumeration unit.\nBecause enumeration units vary in size, do not map totals. Use derived values, such as ratios, rates, proportions, or percentages.\nThe best classing method depends on the data, the map reader and the purpose of the map.\nWhen classifying data, the full range of data must be included and class values should not overlap. No more than six classes are recommended.\nClass symbols (i.e. colors or patterns) must be easily distinguishable.\n\nIn this section of the hands-on exercise, you will learn how to use QGIS to prepare a choropleth map showing the distribution of population with age 65 and above in Singapore by URA’s Master Plan 2014 subzone. You will also gain hands-on experience on the various data classification methods, symbolisation and map layout design techniques offered by QGIS.\n\n4.6.1 Adding geoadministrative layer\n\nDIY: Using the steps you had learned from the previous section, add Master Plan 2014 Subzone Area Boundary (No Sea) layer into QGIS.\n\nYour screen should look similar to the figure below.\n\n\n\n4.6.2 Adding an attribute table in QGIS project\nNow, you will add the POP2020.csv table into the QGIS project. It is stored in \\Hands-on_EX04\\DataTables folder and is in csv format.\n\nFrom the Layers toolbar, click Add Layer -> Add Delimited Text Layer ….\n\nThe Data Source Manager|Delimited Text dialog window appears.\n\n\nAt File Name, click on Browse button at the back.\n\nThe Choose a Delimited Text File to Open dialog window appears.\n• Navigate to -on_Ex04sub folder.\n\n\nClick on POP2020.\n\nClick on the Open button.\n\nYou will return to Data Source Manager|Delimited Text dialog window.\n\nNotice that the dialog window is completed with many information and a preview table.\n\nFor Geometry definition, click on the radio button in front of No geometry (attribute only table).\nClick on Add button.\n\nNotice that a new data layer called POP2020 has been added in the Layers panel.\nWe will close Data Source Manager|Delimited Text dialog window.\n\nClick on OK button.\n\nNext, you will examine the structure of the data.\n• Right-click on POP2020, select Open Attribute Table.\nThe Attribute table dialog window appears.\n\n\n\n4.6.3 Creating relational join\nNow you are ready to perform relational join between the MP14_SubZone GIS layer and the POP2020 attribute layer.\nIn order to join the attribute table of a geospatial data and an aspatial attribute table, we need to identify the common key or popularly known as unique identifier between these two data sets.\n\nDIY: Using the steps you had learned, open the attribute table of MP14_SubZone and POP2020.\n\n\nWith reference to the tables above, the SZ field of POP2020 and SUBZONE_N field of MP14_SUBZONE can be used as the unique identifier filed. However, if you examine the data carefully, there is a problem we should take note of. That is strings in SUBZONE_N are all uppercase. On the other hand, strings in SZ field are made up of upper- and lowercases.\nIn view of this problem, we will create a new field to change strings in SZ into uppercase. We will call the output field SUBZONE.\n\nAt the POP2020 Feature Table, click on Open field calculator icon \n\nThe Field Calculator dialog window appears.\n\nFor Output field name, type SUBZONE.\nFor Output file type, select Text(string) from the drop-down list.\nAt the Expression panel, type as shown below.\n\n\n\nBest practice: This is always a good practice to check the preview to ensure that the result is inline to what you want.\n\n\nClick on OK button when you are ready.\n\nNotice that a new field called SUBZONE has been added into POP2020 data table the strings are all in uppercase.\n\nYou are ready to join both tables now.\n\nFrom the Layers panel, double-click on MP14_SubZone vector layer.\n\nThe Layer Properties dialog window appears.\n• From the Tab menu, click on the Joins tab.\nYour screen should look similar to the figure below.\n\n\nClick on Add new join icon \n\nThe Add Vector Join dialog window appears.\n\nFor Join Layer, select POP2020 from the drop-down list.\nFor Join field, select SUBZONE from the drop-down list.\nFor Target field, select SUBZONE_N from the drop-down list.\n\n\n\nClick on OK button to perform the relational join.\n\nYou will return to the Layer Properties dialog window.\nNotice that a relational joined between POP2020 attribute table and the attribute table of MP14_SubZone has been created.\n\nAt the Layer Properties dialog window, click on the OK button.\n\nStrange, it seems that nothing had happen!\n• At the Layers panel, right click on MP14_SubZone layer and select Open Attribute Table from the context menu.\nYou will notice that the table now contains additional fields from POP2020 attribute layer.\n\nRemember that this joint is temporary. It is not part of the attribute table of MP14_SubZone layer, but is just linked dynamically to the POP2020 attribute layer. If you want to permanently join the attributes, you must save it as a new layer.\n\n\n4.6.4 Creating a choropleth map\nIn this section, you will learn how to create a choropleth map showing the distribution of population age 65 and above by URA’s Master Plan 2014 subzone area.\nFirst, you will create a new field called Age65+ and compute its value by using the calculator function of QGIS.\n\nFrom Layers Panel, right-click on MP14_SubZone, select Open Attribute Table from the context menu.\n\nThe MP14_SubZone attribute table appears.\n\nClick on Open Field Calculator icon .\n\nThe Field calculator dialog window appears.\n\nKeep Create a new field box check.\nFor Output filed name, type Age65+.\nFor Output field type, select Whole number (integer) from the drop-down list.\nAt the Expression panel, build a formula as shown below.\n\n\n\nGentle reminder: Check the preview to ensure that the result is what you want.\n\nTo perform the computation,\n\nClick on the OK button.\n\nNotice that a new field called Age65+ has been added into the attribute table of MP14_SubZone table.\n\nBefore you end this session, you need to save the results into the attribute table permanently.\n\nFrom the icon bar, click on the Toggle editing mode icon .\n\nThe Stop Editing dialog appears.\n\n\nClick on Save button.\nClose the attribute table of MP14_SubZone layer.\n\nYou are ready to prepare the choropleth now.\n\nFrom the Layers panel, double-click on MP14_SubZone layer.\n\nThe Layer Properties dialog window appears.\n\nClick on Symbology tab.\nAt Symbol selection drop-down list, select Graduated from the drop-down list.\nFor Value, select Age65+ from the drop-down list.\nFor Classes, keep it as 5.\nFor Color ramp, choose Blues or any colour of your choice from the drop-down list.\nFor Mode, choose Natural Breaks (Jenks) from the drop-down list. • Click on Classify button.\n\nYour screen should look similar to the figure below.\n\nYou can review the statistical distribution of the classification in histogram.\n\nClick on the Histogram tab.\nClick on Load values button.\n\nYour screen should look similar to the figure below.\n\nThis feature is very useful for casual data analyst because the histogram helps us to understand the differences of each classification method.\n\nClick back Classes tab.\nClick on Apply button.\nClick on the OK button.\n\nYour screen should look similar to the figure below.\n\n\nChallenge: Study the distribution revealed by the choropleth map. Can you identify planning subzones with high concentration of population with age 65 and above? Do these subzone tend to clusters together or randomly distributed?\n\n\nDIY: Using the steps you had learned from the previous sections, create a choropleth maps of percentage of population age 65 and above.\n\n\nChallenge: Compare the two choropleth maps prepared, what conclusion can you draw from the maps?"

Then, you will use the Identify Features tool to query the information.\nIn this section, you will learn how to query information of a selected Shopping feature (marks by a circle in the figure above).\n• At the Map Legend window, click on Shopping layer to make it active.\n• Click on the Identify Features tool.\n• At the Map View window, hovers the mouse over the shopping feature you are interested to query (the one marked in the figure above).\n• Click on an shopping feature.\nYour screen should look similar to the figure below.\n\nNotice that the selected shopping feature was highlighted (i.e. in red) and the Identify Results window appears.\n\nDIY: Using the steps you had learned from this section, query a building feature, a road network feature and a URA planning area feature.\n\n\n\n2.4.3 Query Attribute Table\nThe ability to interactively select a geographic feature and query its associated attribute information is a very powerful feature of a GIS. However, there are times that you would like to see the attributes of all the features in a GIS layer. In this section, you will learn how to use QGIS’s Open Attribute Table function to display the attribute table of a GIS layer.\n• At the Map Legend window, right-click on Building layer.\n• Select Open Attribute Table from the context menu.\nThe Attribute table window appears.\n\nThe table provide detail information of each geographical feature (i.e. building) such as building name, postal code, road name, block number, just to name a few of them.\n\nDIY: Using the steps you had learned from this section, review the attribute table of Shopping and URA MP2014 Planning Area layers.\n\nWhew! That was a lot to take in! Take a deep breath and relax. By now you should have a good understanding of the basic operations of QGIS. You can start playing with it and practice the techniques that you have learned."

Assuming that the root directory of this project is called Hands-on_Ex02,\n\ncreated a sub-folder call data.gov.\n\ninside data.gov, create two new sub-folders. Call them geospatial and aspatial respectively.\nplace the downloaded Master Plan 2014 Subzone Boundary (No Sea), Child Care Services and Street and Places into the geospatial folder.\n\nunzipped their respective zipped files,\nextract the unzipped files, and\nplace them in geospatial folder.\n\nplace the downloaded School Directory and Information zipped file into aspatial sub-folder.\n\nunzipped the file,\ncopy and paste general-information-of-schools.csv into aspatial sub-folder.\n\n\nThe geospatial folder should look similar to the screenshot below.\n\nNotice that besides the geospatial data files, I also include the metadata of the data into the folder. This is because the metadata provide useful information of the data and it is important for us to keep them for future references.\n\n\n3.2.3 Examining the geospatial data\nBefore you add the GIS data into QGIS, you should spend some time to examine the files in geospatial folder.\nNotice that the shapefile version of MP14_SUBZONE_NO_SEA_PL and StreetsandPlaces data sets are actually made up of multiples files that have the same names but with different extensions.\nTable below details the meaning of each file.  Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapefile\nNext, you should also check the projection of the shapefile.\n\nRight-click on the PRJ file of MP14_SUBZONE_NO_SEA_PL\nSelect Open with -> NotePad.\n\nYour NotePad should look similar to the figure below.\n\nFrom the screenshot, it is clear that MP14_SUBZONE_NO_SEA_PL is in svy21 projected coordinate system.\n\nClose the NotePad.\n\nDifferent from shapefile, the geojson and kml files are editing in xml format. You can examine the content of these two files by using either Notepad or WordPad.\n\n\n3.2.4 Adding geospatial data from data.gov into QGIS\nNow, we are ready to bring the geospatial data downloaded from data.giv.sg into QGIS.\n\nFrom Window Desktop, launch QGIS.\n\nYou will start a new QGIS project.\n\nFrom the menu bar, select Project -> New.\n\nNext, you are going to learn how to bring geospatial data sets into QGIS via the Browser panel.\n\nFrom the Browser panel, navigate to the path of Hands-on_Ex02.govas shown in the screenshot below.\n\n\n\nDouble-click on child-care-services-geojson.geojson.\n\nNotice that child-care-services-geojson.geojson is added in the Layer panel and display on the View window as shown below.\n\n\nDIY: Using the steps you had learned, bring in MP14_SUBZONE_NO_SEA_PL.shp and StreetsandPlaces.shp into QGIS.\n\nYour screen should look similar to the figure below.\n\nNotice that child-care-services-geojson layers does not appear on Map View. This is because it is covered by MP14_SUBZONE_NO_SEA_PL layer.\n\nFrom the Layer panel, click on MP14_SUBZONE_NO_SEA_PL layer.\nHold down the left mouse button, drag and place it below child-care-services-geojson.\n\nNow you should see all the active layers appear on the View window as shown below.\n\n\nQGIS Tip: In order to avoid point and line feature layers being blocked away by polygon feature layer, it is always advisible to place the polygon feature layer at the botton of the layer order.\n\nIt is time to save the project.\n\nFrom the menu bar, click Project -> Save (Alternatively, from the icon bar, click on Save Project icon).\nAt the Choose a QGIS project file dialog window, navigate to the root project folder, then provide a proper project name such as Hands-on_Ex02, remember to select QGIS files (.qgs)* from the Save as type: dropdown list.\n\nYour screen should look similar to the figure below.\n\n\nclick on Save button.\n\nNotice that the upper left corner of the top banner is labelled Hands-on_Ex02 instead of untitled now."

    "text": "3.4 Creating Geospatially-Enabled Data\nBy and large, business data such as polyclinics, schools and business establishments do not capture geospatial information such as x- and y- coordinates explicitly. However, it is possible to create geospatially-enabled data from them by using the geocoding technique.\nGeocoding is the process of finding associated geographic coordinates (often expressed as latitude and longitude) from other geographic data, such as street addresses, zip codes or postal codes (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocoding).\n\n3.4.1 Data Preparation\nIn this section, you will learn how to create geospatially enable data by using general-information-of-schools.csv you downloaded from data.gov.sg.\nNote: In this section, we assume that general-information-of-schools.csv is stored in \\Hands-on_Ex02\\data\\data.gov\\aspatial\\ sub-folder and you have Microsoft Excel installed in your computer.\nLet us review the content of general-information-of-schools.csv file.\n\nAt File Explorer, navigate to the sub-folder where general-information-of-schools.csv is stored.\nRight-click on general-information-of-schools.csv file.\nFrom the context menu, select Open with -> Excel.\n\nYour screen should look similar to the figure below.\n\nNotice that general-information-of-schools.csv file consists of 31 fields. However, we only need to retain school_name, address and postal_code field.\n\nUse appropriate Excel function to delete the unwanted fields.\n\nNext, we will create two create two new fields. They are: country and city.\n\nUse appropriate Excel function to create two new fields. Call them country and city.\nFill in the cell below country and city fields with Singapore.\n\nThe final general-information-of-schools.csv should look similar to the screenshot below.\n\n\nUse the Save as function of Excel to save the tidied csv file into Hands-on_Ex02.govsub-folder. Name the output file schools.csv.\n\n\nNote: It is important to ensure that the output file is in csv file format.\n\n\n\n3.4.2 Install the MMQGIS Plugin\nInstead of using the geocoding API of SLA OneMap, in this section you will use the Geocode Tools of MMQGIS plugin developed by Michael Minn.\nTo install the MMQGIS plugin, you will need to load the QGIS plugin repository by following the steps below.\n\nFrom the menu bar, select Plugins –> Manage and Install Plugins.\n\nPlugins dialog window appears as shown below.\n\nNotice that there is a long list of plugins available. We can use the Search function to locate mmqgis plugin easily.\n\nAt Search, type mmqgis.\n\nYour screen should look similar to the figure below.\n\n\nFriendly Advice: It is a good practice to read the documentation of the plugin (i.e. More info: homepage) thoroughly before download or/and using any QGIS plugin.\n\n\nClick on Install Plugin button to run the installer.\n\nAfter installing mmqgis plugin, remember to close the Plugin dialog window.\n\nClick on Close button.\n\n\n\n3.4.3 Geocoding using MMQGIS Plugin\nNow, you are ready geocode schools dataset.\n\nFrom the menu bar, select MMQGIS -> Geocode -> Geocode CSV with Web Service.\n\nWeb Service Geocode dialog window appears.\n\nGeocode Tools of MMQGIS plugin imports addresses from a CSV file. The input CSV file should be encoded in the UTF-8 character set. Although other 8-bit encodings (like Windoze ISO-8859-x) will work if only ASCII characters are present, non-ASCII characters may cause unpredictable behavior.\n\nFrom Input CSV File (UTF-8), click on Browse button.\n\nSelect a file dialog window appears.\n\nNavigate to the path where schools.csv reside.\nClick on schools.csv.\nClick on Open button.\n\nYour screen should similar to the screenshot below.\n\nNotice that the Address, City and Country drop-down lists have been mapped to the corresponding field names in schools.csv. This explains why the data preparation performed in previous step was important and necessary.\nMMQGIS Geocode Tool supports five geocoding services. They are: Google, OpenStreetMap/Nomination, US Census Bureau, ESRI Server and NetToolKit. Except OpenStreetMap/Nomination, the rest of the geocoding services required you to have an API key.\nIn this exercise, OpenStreetmap/Nominatim geocoding service will be used.\n\nWarning: To complete this section, you will need internet access to run the geocoding process.\n\n\nFor Web Service, select OpenStreetMap/Nominatim from the drop-down list.\n\nGeocode Tool will generate two output files. They are a point feature GIS data set along with a Not Found CSV file containing all rows that could not be geocoded (for whatever reason). We need to tell Geocode Tool where to keep these two output files.\n\nUse File Explorer to create a new sub-folder called geocoding in -on_Ex02 directory.\nFor Output File Name, click on Browse button.\n\nCreate or select a file dialog window appears.\n\nNavigate to the newly create geocoding sub-folder.\nFor File name, type geocoded_sch.shp.\nClick on Save button.\n\nYou also need to provide the Not Found List Output list a place holder.\n\nFor Not Found Output list, click on Browse button.\n\nCreate or select a file dialog window appears.\n\nNavigate to the newly create geocoding sub-folder.\nFor File name, type not_found_sch.scv.\nClick on Save button.\n\nThe completed dialog window should look similar to the screenshot below.\n\nNow, you are ready to perform the geocoding function.\n• At the Web Service Geocode dialog window, click on Apply button.\nWhen the geocoding function is completed, notice that a new shapefile layer will be added on QGIS map window. At the same time, the progress bar will indicate numbers of records that have been geocoded successfully as shown below.\n\nThe output report shows that out of the 346 schools data records, 325 of them have been geocoded successfully.\n\nclick on Close button to closed the dialog window.\n\nLet us examine the layer properties of the newly created geocoded_sch layer.\n\nHover your mouse over geocoded_sch layer, right-click and select Open Attribute Table from the context menu.\n\nThe Attribute table of geocoded_sch appears.\n\nNotice that all columns from the input CSV file are added as attributes in the output shapefile. Six additional fields are added to in the shapefile. The category and type fields are internal from OpenStreetMap. They provide useful data classification for the schools data sets.\n\nDIY: Using the steps your had learned in previous section, examine and transform the coordinate system of geocoded_sch data set into SVY21 projected coordinate system."

    "text": "5.1 What is Trade Area Analysis\nA trade area is the geographic area from which a business draws its customers. The size of a trade area depends on the variety of goods and services offered in the community and its proximity to competing retail markets. In most cases, consumers are willing to travel further to purchase high order goods, such as automobiles, furniture, recreational vehicles, and specialty items than they are to purchase lower order goods, such as clothing, drugs, groceries and gasoline.\nTrade area analysis is a methodology, process or technique that provides a basis for understanding, visualizing and quantifying the extent and characteristics of known or approximated trade areas. It has been used by businesses to gain better understanding on the geographic extent and characteristics of business patronage, to assess business performance spatially, to perform competitive analysis, to evaluate market penetration and to identify market gap. Prior to GIS age, trade area analysis was a very time-consuming process. A simple trade area study for a retail operation can easily take more than six months or a year to complete. Today, with appropriate and readily available GIS data and open source GIS such as QGIS, it is possible to complete a trade area analysis within a week.\nIn this exercise, you will learn how to use the GIS analysis functions such as buffering, overlaying, voronoi diagram to delineate trade areas of a retail business. You will also learn how to use appropriate GIS analyse and mapping techniques to analyse and visualize the potential customers of these trade areas.\n\n5.1.1 Setting the Scene\nXBS is a well established local bank. It has a total of 30 branches scatter around the country. The bank is planning to launch a special low interest loan programme to help small- and medium-scale enterprises (SME) to improve the productivity of their workers. Before the scheme is launched, Richard Lim, the Senior Vice President of XBS Retail Banking would like to find out the numbers of SMEs located within the trade areas of XBS branches.\n\n\n5.1.2 Framing the Problem and Collecting the Data\nThree GIS data are available for this study. They are:\n\nLocations of Banking facilities and their associated information (i.e. Banking)\nLocation SME and their associated information (i.e. SME)\nOutline map of Singapore (i.e. CoastalOutline)\n\nThese dataset can be found in the Hands-on_Ex06.zip. You are required to download them and save into your local drive. Throughout this hands-on exercise, we will assume that these GIS data and other derived GIS data are stored in the \\SMT201\\Hands-on_Ex06 sub-folder of your local drive."

We are only interested on bank branches belong to XBS. In this section, you will learn how to extract a subset of dataset from a master dataset using GIS query function.\nBefore you can perform attribute query, you need to examine the Banking layer careful and to identify the appropriate field and object name (s) to query.\n\nAt Browser pane, right-click on Banking.\nFrom the context menu, select Open Attribute Table.\n\nThe Attribute Table window appears.\n\nNotice that a total of 2908 rows and each row represents a geospatial point object, in this case a particular banking facility. For example, the first record represents a SAM machine.\nIf you scroll downwards, you will find that under the DESC field there are a collection of records with a description of XBS. This is actually the XBS branches.\nNext, you will extract all the XBS branches using the query function of QGIS.\n\nAt the Attribute Table window click on Select feature using an expression icon.\n\n\nThe Selection by expression dialog window appears.\n\n\nAt the upper left corner of the window, click on the Expression tab.\nFor Search, click on Fields and Values.\nScroll downwards until DESC field appears.\nDouble click on DESC field.\n\nNotice that the syntax “DESC” has been entered on the Expression pane.\n\nNow, you are going to enter the expression.\n\nFrom the Expression pane, click on = icon.\n\nNext, you are going complete the query statement by providing the field value.\n\nAt the Values pane, click on the all unique button.\n\nYour screen should look similar to the figure below.\n\n\nDouble-click on XBS.\n\nThe query statement in the Expression pane should look similar to the figure below.\n\nNext, you will execute the query.\n\nClick on Select Features button.\nClick on Close button.\n\nYou will return to Attribute Table window.\nIf you scroll downwards now, you will notice that all records with XBS in DESC field are highlighted as shown in the figure below. This shows that banking facilities which are XBS branches have been selected.\n\nNow, you are going to save these selected records including their corresponding spatial objects into a new GIS data file. This GIS data will be stored in GeoPackage format.\n\nUse the steps you had learned from previous hands-on exercise, save the output in Geopackage format. Name the newly created GIS layer XBS_branches. Symbolising the XBS_branches using appropriate maker. Lastly, remove Banking GIS layer from the Browser pane because you no longer need it anymore.\n\nYour screen should look similar to the screenshot below after the customization.\n\n\n\n5.2.3 Using Spatial Query to Select a Subset from a Master Layer\nIt is not unusual that the original dataset provided for an analysis are full of dirty data. It is important for an analyst to review the datasets carefully and to exclude these data from the analysis. In this section, you will learn how to use the Spatial Query function of QGIS to interactive select several dirty data and then delete them from the SME GIS data layer.\nLet us examine the spatial extend of the SME layer.\n\nAt Browser panel, right-click on SME.\nSelect Zoom to Layer(s) from the context menu.\n\nNotice that there are a collection of points located at the lower left of the Map View window. Obviously, this is not logical because all the points representing the locations of the SMEs should fall within the boundary Singapore island.\n\nThis problem happens mainly because some SMEs were not geocoded properly.\nNext, you will learn how to use the spatial selection function of QGIS to select all the SMEs fall within the national boundary and save them in a new GIS data file. Again, keep this data in GeoPackage format.\n\nFrom the icon bar, click on the drop-down list next to Selection icon.\n\n\n\nSelect Select Feature(s) from the drop-down list.\nAt Browser panel, click on SME to make sure that it is the active layer.\nClick and drape to form a rectangle to cover all the points fall within Singapore island.\n\nYour screen should look similar to the screenshot below.\n\n\nNext, release the mouse.\n\nNotice that all the selected points will be highlighted.\n\n\nDIY: Use the steps you had learned from previous section, save the output in GeoPackage format. Name the newly created GIS layer SMEs. Symbolising the SMEs using appropriate maker. Lastly, remove SME layer from the Browser panel because you no longer need it anymore.\n\nYour screen should look similar to the screenshot below."

    "text": "5.3 Trade Area Delineation\n\n5.3.1 Delineating Ring Trade Areas using Buffering Tool\nThe buffer zone method is one of the quickest and simplest procedures for delineating a catchment area, representing the area by means of one or more concentric circles with the location at their centre (core, close and outer area, see Fig. 1).\n\nIn this method, each zone is determined by the radius of the buffer zone measured ‘as the crow flies’. Traditionally, delineating trade areas for a collection retail outlets such as bank branches can be rather time-consuming. With GIS, trade areas can be delineated using the buffering tool of QGIS.\nIn this section, you are going to create a 1km buffer around the XBS bank branches.\n\nFrom the menu bar, select Vector -> Geoprocessing Tools -> Buffer.. .\n\nThe Buffer dialog window appears.\n\nFor Input layer, select XBS_branches from the drop-down list.\nFor Distance, type 1000. (Do you know why?)\nFor Segments, type 100. (Do you know why?)\n\nKeep the rest of setting as default.\nYour screen should look similar to the screenshot below.\n\nNext, you will run the buffering process.\n\nClick on Run button.\n\nWhen the geoprocessing process completed, the Buffer dialog window will be updated with the geoprocessing log as shown in the screenshot below.\n\n\nGood Practice: Always read the output log carefully before moving to the next step.\n\nSince the buffering process is completed without any error, you can close the Buffer dialog window now.\n• From Buffer dialog window, click on Close button.\nNotice that a new GIS layer called Buffered has been added into the Browser panel.\nBy default, the output is stored in the memory as shown in the screenshot below.\n\nIn order to avoid losing the analysis result, it is wiser for us to save buffering output in local drive.\n\nDIY: Using the steps you had learned in previous hands-on exercise, save the output buffering layer into GeoPackage format. Name the newly create layer Overlapping_buffer_1km. Also, don’t forget to remove the temporary output layer!\n\nYour screen should look similar to the screenshot below.\n\nA close examination of the screenshot above, we will notice that there are several overlapping buffers especially at the down-town area.\nNext, you will delineate dissolved buffers to overcome the overlapping buffers problem.\n\nDIY: Repeat the steps above to delineate a new set of trade areas using the buffering tool. Use the configurations similar to the steps above except check the Dissolve results. Name the output GeoPackage layer as Dissolved_buffer_1km. Also, don’t forget to remove the temporary output layer!\n\nYour result should look similar to the screenshot below.\n\n\n\n5.3.2 Delineating Trade Areas using Voronoi Tool\nVoronoi polygons, also known as Thiessen polygons, represent areas of influence around a set of focal points (or retail outlets as in this study). They can be generated based on a set of points as centroid for the polygons. Voronoi polygons have been so constructed that each polygon contains exactly one of the outlets and that any location with a Voronoi polygon is closer to that point outlet (centroid) than to any other point outlets.\nThis polygon structure is constructed by using the perpendicular bisectors between neighbouring points (in this case, retail outlets) as the boundaries of the resulting Voronoi polygons.\n\n\nFrom the menu bar, select Vector -> Geometric Tools -> Voronoi Polygon.\n\nVoronoi Polygons dialog window appears.\n\nFor Input layer, select XBS_branches from the drop-down list.\nFor Buffer region, type 100. (Do you know why?)\n\nYour screen should look similar to the screenshot below.\n\nNext, you will run the geoprocess.\n\nAt Voronoi Polygons dialog window, click on Run button.\n\nWhen the voronoi polygon computation process completed, you screen should look similar to the screenshot below.\n\nYou can close Voronoi Polygons dialog window now.\n\nFrom Voronoi Polygons dialog window, click on Close button.\n\n\nDIY: Using the steps you had learned from previous section, save the output as GeoPackage layer. Name the output file Voronoi_TAs. Remember to remove the temporary layer from Browser pane.\n\nYour screen should look similar to the screenshot below."

You will use the Dissolved buffer for bank branch drawing as the input drawing and Voronoi area for bank branch as the overlay drawing. The topology overlay operator used will be Intersect.\n\n5.4.1 Creating a composite catchment areas\n\nFrom the main menu, select Vector -> Geoprocessing Tools -> Intersection.\n\nThe Intersection dialog window appears.\n\nFor Input layer, select Voronoi_TAs from the drop-down list.\nFor Intersection layer, select Dissolved_buffer_1km from the drop-down list.\n\nYour screen should look similar to the screenshot below.\n\n\nClick on Run to perform the overlaying process.\n\nAfter the Intersection computation completed, close the dialog window.\n\nFrom the Intersection dialog window, click on Close button.\n\n\nDIY: Using the steps you had learned from previous section, save the newly computed layer as Geopackage layer. Name the output GIS layer as Composite_TAs.\n\nYour screen should look similar to the screenshot below.\n\n\n\n5.4.2 Selecting SMEs within the Composite Trade Areas\nNow you are going to select SMEs fall within the composite catchment areas of XBS bank branches.\n\nFrom the menu bar, select Vector -> Analysis Tools -> Count Points in Polygon.\n\nCount Points in Polygon dialog window appears.\n\nFor Polygons, select Composite_TAs from the drop-down list.\nFor Points, select SMEs from the drop-down list.\nFor Count field name, you can either provide your own name or keep the default.\n\nYour screen should look similar to the screenshot below.\n\nWne you are ready to run the process,\n\nClick on Run button.\n\nWhen the computation completed, the Log report appears.\nNotice that a new temporary GIS layer called COUNT has beenn added on the Browser panel.\n\nClick on Close button to close the dialog window.\n\n\nDIY: Using the steps you had learned from previous section, save the output as GeoPackage layer. Name the output file Composite_TAs_SMEs. Remember to remove the temporary layer from Browser panel.\n\nIf you compare Composite_TAs and Composite_TAs_SMEs layers visually, both of them look very similar. However, if you compare their attribute tables you will notice that a new column called NUMPOINTS has been added in the attribute table of Composite_TAs_SMEs.\n\nThe NUMPOINTS field is populated with numbers. Actually, these numbers represent total number of SMEs fall within the trade areas."

    "text": "5.5 Preparing a Choropleth map\nChoropleth mapping involves the symbolization of enumeration units, such as countries, provinces, states, counties or census units, using area patterns or graduated colors. For example, a crime analyst may need to use a choropleth map to portray the spatial patterns of household income distribution of Singapore by DGP (Development Guide Plan) Subzone.\nThe major concerns of choropleth mapping are the method of data classification, areal symbolization, and the overall map design. General rules for choropleth mapping are as follows:\n\nUse data that are assumed to be uniform throughout an enumeration unit.\nBecause enumeration units vary in size, do not map totals. Use derived values, such as ratios, rates, proportions, or percentages.\nThe best classing method depends on the data, the map reader and the purpose of the map.\nWhen classifying data, the full range of data must be included and class values should not overlap. No more than six classes are recommended.\nClass symbols (i.e. colors or patterns) must be easily distinguishable.\n\n\nDIY: Use the steps you had learned from previous lesson, prepare a choropleth map showing the number of SMEs fall within the trade areas of XBS branches.\n\nYour screen should look similar to the screenshot below."
