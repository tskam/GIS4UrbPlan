This workbook has two unique features. Firstly, all the exercises are developed based on [QGIS](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/), an open source GIS toolkit with full GIS functions including 3-D modelling, Network Analysis and image analysis. Secondly, all the use cases and data sets are from [Singapore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore), one of the amazing city-state in the world with diverse culture.
