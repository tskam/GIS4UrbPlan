# GIS Mapping and Geovisualisation

Geovisualization or “Geographic Visualization” concerns the visual representations of geospatial data and the use of cartographic techniques to support visual analytics. In this exercise, you will learn how to prepare qualitative and quantitative geovisualisation by using QGIS. You will also learn how to create a joint table by using the concept of georelational data model of GIS.

## Learning Outcome

By the end of this session, you will be able to use QGIS

-   to prepare qualitative maps,
-   to create proportional symbol map,
-   to perform georelational join,
-   to compute new field from existing fields, and
-   to prepare choropleth map.

## Data

For the purpose of this hands-on exercise, three data sets are provided. They are:

-   `education` provides general information of public primary schools, secondary schools and junior colleges. This data set was downloaded from Data.gov.sg and geocoded by using SLA OneMap Api.
-   `sgpools` provides information of SG Pools outlets and stores information.
-   `POP2020` provides population by age group as at June 2020. It is downloaded from Department of Statistics (DOS), Singapore. The data set provides multiple years of population data. For the purpose of this exercise, only 2020 data were extracted.

These three data sets are in csv file format. They can be found in `DataTables` of `Hand-on_Ex03` folder.

Besides the above three data sets, you are required to download the following geospatial from public web sites:

-   *National Map Polygon* from Data.gov.sg
-   *Master Plan 2014 Subzone Boundary (No Sea)* from Data.gov.sg
-   *Road Section Line* from [LTA Data Mall](https://datamall.lta.gov.sg/content/datamall/en.html).

### Data Preparation

> DIY: Using the steps you had learned from the previous hands-on exercise, convert the *education* and *SGPools* data sets in `DataTables` folder into geospatial data layer and store them into an integrated database called `SG`. The geospatial database must be in **GeoPackage** format.

> DIY: Using the steps you had learned from the previous hands-on exercise, convert the geospatial data sets downloaded from Data.gov.sg and LTA Data Mall into the newly created `SG` database.

## Getting Started

> DIY: Launch QGIS. Create a new project call `Hands-on_Ex03`. Provide the project with a correct referencing system.

## Creating Proportional Symbol Map

**Proportional symbol** maps (also known as **graduate symbol** maps) are a class of maps that use the visual variable of size to represent differences in the magnitude of a discrete, abruptly changing phenomenon, e.g. counts of people. Like choropleth maps, you can create classed or unclassed versions of these maps. The classed ones are known as **range-graded** or **graduated symbols**, and the unclassed are called **proportional symbols**, where the area of the symbols are proportional to the values of the attribute being mapped.

In this section, you will learn how to create a proportional symbol map showing the numbers of win by Singapore Pools' outlets.

> DIY: Before we get started, let us switch off `Education`, `RoadSectionLine` and `SGOutline` layers.

Your screen should look similar to the figure below.

## Choropleth map using GIS

**Choropleth mapping** involves the symbolisation of enumeration units, such as countries, provinces, states, counties or census units, using area patterns or graduated colors. For example, a social scientist may need to use a choropleth map to portray the spatial distribution of aged population of Singapore by Master Plan 2014 Subzone Boundary.

The major concerns of choropleth mapping are the method of data classification, areal symbolization, and the overall map design. General rules for choropleth mapping are as follows:

-   Use data that are assumed to be uniform throughout an enumeration unit.
-   Because enumeration units vary in size, do not map totals. Use derived values, such as ratios, rates, proportions, or percentages.
-   The best classing method depends on the data, the map reader and the purpose of the map.
-   When classifying data, the full range of data must be included and class values should not overlap. No more than six classes are recommended.
-   Class symbols (i.e. colors or patterns) must be easily distinguishable.

In this section of the hands-on exercise, you will learn how to use QGIS to prepare a choropleth map showing the distribution of population with age 65 and above in Singapore by URA's Master Plan 2014 subzone. You will also gain hands-on experience on the various data classification methods, symbolisation and map layout design techniques offered by QGIS.

### Adding geoadministrative layer

> DIY: Using the steps you had learned from the previous section, add `Master Plan 2014 Subzone Area Boundary (No Sea)` layer into QGIS.

Your screen should look similar to the figure below.

![](img03/image17.jpg)

### Adding an attribute table in QGIS project

Now, you will add the POP2020.csv table into the QGIS project. It is stored in `\Hands-on_EX03\DataTables` folder and is in csv format.

-   From the **Layers** toolbar, click **Add Layer** -\> **Add Delimited Text Layer ...**.

Next, you will examine the structure of the data.

• Right-click on `POP2020`, select **Open Attribute Table**.

The Attribute table dialog window appears.

![](img03/image21.jpg)

### Creating relational join

Now you are ready to perform relational join between the MP14_SubZone GIS layer and the POP2020 attribute layer.

In order to join the attribute table of a geospatial data and an aspatial attribute table, we need to identify the common key or popularly known as **unique identifier** between these two data sets.

> DIY: Using the steps you had learned, open the attribute table of MP14_SubZone and POP2020.

![](img03/image22.jpg)

With reference to the tables above, the *SZ* field of `POP2020` and *SUBZONE_N* field of `MP14_SUBZONE` can be used as the unique identifier filed. However, if you examine the data carefully, there is a problem we should take note of. That is strings in *SUBZONE_N* are all uppercase. On the other hand, strings in *SZ* field are made up of upper- and lowercases.

In view of this problem, we will create a new field to change strings in *SZ* into uppercase. We will call the output field *SUBZONE*.

-   At the **POP2020 Feature Table**, click on **Open field calculator** icon ![](img03/image23.jpg){width="5%"}

The **Field Calculator** dialog window appears.

-   For **Output field name**, type *SUBZONE*.

-   For **Target field**, select **SUBZONE_N** from the drop-down list.

![](img03/image28.jpg){width="350"}

-   Click on **OK** button to perform the relational join.

You will return to the **Layer Properties** dialog window.

Notice that a relational joined between `POP2020` attribute table and the attribute table of `MP14_SubZone` has been created.

-   At the **Layer Properties** dialog window, click on the **OK** button.

Strange, it seems that nothing had happen!

• At the **Layers** panel, right click on `MP14_SubZone` layer and select **Open Attribute Table** from the context menu.

You will notice that the table now contains additional fields from POP2020 attribute layer.

![](img03/image29.jpg)

Remember that this joint is temporary. It is not part of the attribute table of `MP14_SubZone` layer, but is just linked dynamically to the `POP2020` attribute layer. If you want to permanently join the attributes, you must save it as a new layer.

### Creating a choropleth map

In this section, you will learn how to create a choropleth map showing the distribution of population age 65 and above by URA's Master Plan 2014 subzone area.

First, you will create a new field called Age65+ and compute its value by using the calculator function of QGIS.
