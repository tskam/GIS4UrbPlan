# Cartographic Modelling with Raster-based GIS

The true power of a GIS is its analytical capability. In this hands-on exercise, you will learn how to perform raster-based GIS analysis also popularly known as mapthematics by using QGIS.

By the end of this session, you will be able to:

-   create a raster data from a vector GIS layer,

-   extract raster layer,

-   georeference a raster layer and

-   derive proximity layer(s) by using distance function of QGIS.

## Data Preparation

Two GIS data are available for the analysis. They are:

-   Location of primary, secondary, mixed and JC (i.e. Education).
-   Outline map of Singapore (i.e. CoastalOutline).

### Add the GIS data into QGIS Project

Before you can start to perform any analysis, you need to start a new QGIS project.

> DIY: Using the steps you had learned from last lesson, add the Education and CoastalOutline into the newly created QGIS project.

### Using attribute query to select a subset from a master layer

The Education layer consists of locations of education institutions such as primary schools, secondary school, mixed and JC. We are only interested on education institutions that belong to primary and secondary schools.

> DIY: Using the steps you had learned from last lesson, extract and save the primary and secondary schools in two separate GIS vector layers.

Your screen should look similar to the figure below.

## Accessibility Modelling using Raster-based GIS Analysis

In this section, you will learn the basic concept of accessibility from geospatial perspective. You will also learn how to use appropriate raster GIS analyse function and mapping techniques to analyse and visualize accessibility maps.

## Creating proximity layer using raster GIS analysis

In this section, you will learn how to perform proximity analysis and derived distance layer using raster GIS analysis function. You will use the raster version of the primary school layer as the target layer in the analysis instead of the vector version of the primary schools layer (Do you know why?)

You will perform the task using the rasterize function of Geospatial Data Abstraction Library (GDAL), a library for reading and writing raster geospatial data formats, and is released under the permissive X/MIT style free software license by the Open Source Geospatial Foundation. As a library, it presents a single abstract data model to the calling application for all supported formats. It may also be built with a variety of useful command-line utilities for data translation and processing (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDAL).

-   From the **Processing Toolbox** panel, navigate to **GDAL Analysis** -\> **Proximity (raster distance)**.

## Terrain Analysis and Visualisation

Elevation and related terrain variables are important in most people lives. Terrain determines the natural availability and location of surface water, and hence soil moisture and drainage. Terrain also strongly influences the location and nature of transportation networks, and the cost and methods of house and road construction. Prior to the introduction of GIS, the modelling and analysis of terrain data was a very mathematically demanding process which was usually only performed by geoscience and mapping science specialists. Today, modern GIS tool such as QGIS has made terrain modelling, anaysis and mapping relatively easy to perform by casual data analysts. In this section, you will learn how to:

-   download Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data from online open source repository,
-   mosaic multiple DEM data into one,
-   extract DEM for a study area,
-   compute terrain parameters such as slope, aspect, and hillshading, and
-   perform visibility analysis.

### Downloading DEM data from USGS Earth Explorer

> DIY: Using the steps you had learned, remove the raw DEM layers, temporaly *Merged*, *Clipped* and Reprojected layers from QGIS.

### Visibility Analysis with Raster GIS

Visibility analysis is a widely used function in GIS. It identifies areas that can or cannot be seen from a single (or a set of) viewpoint(s). The clearly visible parts of an observer's surrounding area, as well as hidden parts, may thus be evaluated.\
Visibility analysis proves useful when selecting the best or optimal locations in urban studies, e.g., placement of various facilities which should be made visible (nice, interesting places) or those which should be rather hidden (e.g. wind turbines). Apart from architecture, visibility analysis is useful for tourism purposes, archaeology, communication engineering, and may be highly serviceable in the military.

In this section, you will learn how to perform visibility between two Satellite Earth Stations by using QGIS.

> DIY: By applying appropriate symbolising methods for raster layer you had learned, design a cartography quality view look similar to the screenshot below.

![](img06/image85.jpg)

### Profile Analysis

Another useful GIS analysis using DEM is calling profile analysis. Profiles or more appropriately called topographic profiles are cross-sectional views **showing elevation along a line**. In other words, if you could slice the Earth along that line and view it from the side, that two-dimensional graph displaying height would be a topographic profile.

Figure below shows a cross-section profile view of Singapore Island Country Club. The red line on the map is the cross-section line. The line graph below the map is popularly known as profile graph whereby the x-axis is distance between the starting point and the end point of the cross-section line. The y-axis, on-the-other-hand, shows the elevation heights of the cross-section line. The unit of measurement is in meter.

![](img06/image66.jpg)

Topographic profiles have different terms to describe them -- vertical profiles, cross-section graphs, or 2D elevation charts. They can help you assess the difficulty of a trail or evaluate the feasibility of placing a rail line along a given route.

Profile analysis have different uses in engineering (like fiber optic cable design), hydrology (slope along a channel with a rise-over-run), and land use planning (ski slope design).
