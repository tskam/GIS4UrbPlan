# Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) Change Detection  with Vector-based GIS Analysis

In this hands-on exercise, you will learn how to perform LULC change detection by using vector-based geoprocessing and GIS analysis functions of QGIS.

By the end of this session, you will be able to:

-   prepare GIS layers by using appropriate geoprocessing functions of QGIS,

-   detect LULC changes by using appropriate overlay and statistical analysis functions of QGIS, and

-   communicate the analysis results by using appropriate geovisualisation and mapping functions of QGIS.
