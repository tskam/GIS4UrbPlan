# Beyond Mapping: Vector-based GIS Analysis for Urban Applications

The true power of a GIS of is its geoprocessing and analysis capability. In this hands-on exercise, you will learn how to combine geoprocessing and GIS analysis function of QGIS to meet urban application needs.

By the end of this session, you will be able to:

-   extract geospatial data by using appropriate geoprocessing functions of QGIS,

-   create a GeoPackage database and save the extracted geospatial data into GeoPackage data table,

-   transform the referencing system of the geospatial data into from geographic coordinate system (i.e wgs84) to projected coordinate system (i.e svy21). integration using appropriate overlay and statistical analysis functions of QGIS,

-   derive new field from geospatial properties by using QGIS attribute table tools, and

-   prepare statistical graphic by using **Data Plotly** plugin of QGIS.

## Getting Started

### The Task

Every fives years, Urban Redevelopment Authority of Singapore will publish the new Land-Use Master Plan (MP). It is the statutory land use plan which guides Singapore's development in the medium term over the next 10 to 15 years. The latest version was published in 2019 and the digital version is available at data.gov.sg.

In this hands-on exercise we are interested to understand the distribution of land areas by land-use allocation at the planning subzone level. The target planning area is Punggol area which comprises of seven subzones.

Two data sets will be used in this exericse, they are:

-   [Master Plan 2019 Subzone Boundary (No Sea)](https://data.gov.sg/dataset/master-plan-2019-subzone-boundary-no-sea)

-   [Master Plan 2019 Land Use layer](https://data.gov.sg/dataset/master-plan-2019-land-use-layer)

### Creating the project folder

-   Create a new project folder called `Hands-on_Ex04` or any name of your choice.

-   Create a new sub-folder called `data.gov` or any name of your choice.

### Downloading the data sets

**Clip** dialog window should look similar to the screenshot below.

![](img04/image23.jpg)

-   When you are ready to run the process, click on **Run** button.

Op! It seems that the process failed to complete due to invalid geometry issue.

![](img04/image24.jpg)

Less worry, this is very common in geoprocessing operations because of dirty or untidy data such as slivers. The issue can be addressed by using the Advanced options tool of QGIS's geoprocessing operations.

-   At **Clip** dialog window, click on **Parameters** tab.

    ![](img04/image25.jpg){width="199"}
